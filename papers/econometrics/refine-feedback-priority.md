## Comment 5

**Contradiction in CEO identification and sample selection rules**

"Finding CEOs among all individuals from the data requires heuristics since job titles are inconsistently recorded. When explicit ``managing director'' titles exist, we use them directly. For remaining cases, we assume all representatives are CEOs if three or fewer exist at the firm. ... We apply several restrictions to create a sample suitable for productivity analysis. First, we exclude mining and finance sectors due to specialized accounting frameworks and regulatory environments. Second, we drop firms ever having more than 2 simultaneous CEOs to avoid complex governance structures that complicate identification."

**Message:** At first glance the “three or fewer” identification rule seems to conflict with the later restriction that drops firms with “more than 2 simultaneous CEOs.”  Because the first rule is applied only at the raw-registry parsing stage, while the second governs the cleaned analysis sample, there is in fact no contradiction—observations with three concurrent representatives are identified but later excluded.  

A separate, more substantive point remains.  The final sample can contain firm-years with exactly two simultaneous CEOs, yet the core model $y_{it}=z_{m(i,t)}+e_{it}$ presumes a single manager identifier per firm-year.  The draft does not explain how such cases are handled—whether one CEO is selected, the pair is treated as a joint “CEO team,” or the observations are otherwise adjusted.  Clarifying this handling would strengthen transparency and replicability.


## Comment 13

**Clarification on the object of interest in the covariance expectation**

"Under the model assumptions, these moments have the expectation
\begin{align}
\mathbb E\widehat{\Cov}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) &= \Bar\lambda + A,\\
\mathbb E\widehat{\Var}(\Delta \hat z_i) &= \Bar\lambda + B,
\end{align}
where $\Bar\lambda$ is the average variance of true CEO effect changes across groups (the object of interest), and $A$ and $B$ are \emph{bias terms} that depend on the spell-length distributions, event-window designs, and the autocovariance structure of shocks."

**Message:** Statement (3) is correct for the class of contrasts the paper studies, namely pre–post \emph{differences} in outcomes for which the signal component satisfies $\Delta y_i^{\text{signal}}=\Delta z_i$.  Under this restriction $\Cov(\Delta y_i^{\text{signal}},\Delta z_i)=\Var(\Delta z_i)$, so the same parameter $\bar\lambda$ legitimately appears in both equations (3) and (4).  Because this zero-sum property is explicit only in the example and in Appendix A (where the weight vector $\mathbf w$ obeys $\mathbf w'\mathbf 1=0$), consider adding a brief sentence in the main text to remind readers that “general linear contrast” always refers to a pre–post difference with weights summing to zero.  This would pre-empt the impression that equation (3) covers arbitrary contrasts.

## Comment 14

**Omission of scaling factor in debiasing formulas**

"Debiased moments.} Subtracting the placebo moments from the treated moments yields debiased estimates:
\begin{align}
\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) &= \widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{tr}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) - \widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i),\\
\widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta \hat z_i) &= \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{tr}}(\Delta \hat z_i) - \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta \hat z_i).
\end{align}"

**Message:** I initially had trouble with the “Debiased moments” formulas because, read literally, they appear to subtract the raw placebo moments even when the proportional-autocovariance assumption implies a variance-ratio scaling. Only after re-reading the preceding paragraph did I understand that the authors intend $\widehat{\Cov}^{\text{pl}}$ and $\widehat{\Var}^{\text{pl}}$ to denote the placebo moments \emph{after} multiplication by the estimated variance ratio. To spare readers the same detour, consider adding a sentence clarifying that the symbols with the “pl” superscript refer to the placebo moments \emph{already rescaled} by $\hat c=\sigma_1^{2}/\sigma_0^{2}$.

## Comment 15

**Ambiguity in the definition of bias terms A and B**

"The key insight is that for placebo transitions, there is no true CEO effect change: $\Delta z_i = 0$ for all placebo firms. Yet the placebo sample has the same spell-length distribution and event-window design as the treated sample. Therefore, the placebo moments recover the bias terms:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) \xrightarrow{p} A,\qquad \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta \hat z_i) \xrightarrow{p} B.
\end{equation}"

**Message:** The same symbols $A$ and $B$ are used for the bias terms in both the treated and the placebo samples. Because the proportional-autocovariance assumption implies $A_{\text{tr}} = c\,A_{\text{pl}}$ and $B_{\text{tr}} = c\,B_{\text{pl}}$, employing identical notation can obscure which version of the bias a given sentence is referring to. Introducing subscripts (e.g., $A_{\mathrm{pl}}, B_{\mathrm{pl}}$ versus $A_{\mathrm{tr}}, B_{\mathrm{tr}}$) or adding a brief explanatory sentence would make the progression of the argument easier to follow.

## Comment 16

**Explanation for changing slope bias in unbalanced panels**

"Post-arrival dynamics look less gradual than under persistence alone, plausibly because typical spells are shorter in unbalanced panels, leaving less time for any gradual buildup to manifest."

**Message:** Statement “Post-arrival dynamics look less gradual … leaving less time for any gradual buildup to manifest” briefly puzzled me because the paper elsewhere stresses that the “gradual buildup” in the naïve profile is a biased artefact, not a real dynamic effect.  After rereading the preceding paragraphs I realised the authors are still talking about the biased naïve pattern and are simply offering an intuitive reason – shorter average spells change the weighting of shocks in the bias terms – for why that pattern weakens in the unbalanced-panel scenario.  The explanation is correct, but you might consider adding a clause such as “in the naïve estimates” to make it unmistakable that the reference is to the spurious, not the true, dynamics.

## Comment 17

**Ambiguous notation for industry and spell**

"Concretely, let \(r_{it}\) denote firm revenue and let \(\tilde r_{it}=r_{it}-\bar r_{st}\) be revenue demeaned by industry–year \((s,t)\) cells. Let \(\mathbb 1\{\text{spell}=s\}\) indicate the A or B spell. The spell effect is
\begin{equation}
\hat z_{is} = \frac{1}{T_{is}}\sum_{t\in s} \tilde r_{it},\qquad s\in\{A,B\}.
\end{equation}"

**Message:** At first the symbol $s$ looks overloaded: in $\bar r_{st}$ it serves as the industry index inside the industry–year mean, while in the very next sentence $s\in\{A,B\}$ labels the two CEO spells. Because the first $s$ is bound within the demeaning operator, a careful reader will realize the two meanings never interact, yet the immediate juxtaposition can still slow the reader down. Consider using different letters for industry and spell to keep the exposition friction-free.

## Comment 18

**Clarification of spell definition for CEO effects**

"For each transition from CEO A to CEO B, let the firm have two consecutive spells covering the entire tenures of A and B (not just the event window). We estimate a spell-level CEO effect as the within-spell mean of demeaned revenue."

**Message:** Readers accustomed to event studies that use fixed, symmetric windows might wonder why the spell effect $\hat z_{is}$ is averaged over the CEO’s entire tenure. A short reminder that the bias the paper corrects is a function of the actual spell length—already explained in Section 2—would make the rationale for this design choice immediately transparent.

## Comment 19

**Clarification on scaling placebo moments**

"Because the design matrices and weights are the same by construction, and because we assume the error autocovariance (Σ) is the same up to a scalar between treated and placebo groups, the covariance and variance bias components can be "precomputed" in the placebo sample and subtracted from the treated estimates. This delivers debiased variance of Δ ĥz and debiased event-study coefficients β<sub>ℓ</sub>."

**Message:** Statement that the placebo moments are “precomputed … and subtracted” could momentarily make a new reader wonder whether the scalar implied by the proportional-autocovariance assumption is being applied.  Since Section 3 already defines the debiasing formulas with the factor $c$ (e.g.\ $\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{tr}}-c\,\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}$), the procedure is correct; but adding a short reminder that the placebo moments are first multiplied by the estimated variance ratio would remove any possible ambiguity.

## Comment 20

**Apparent tension in sample descriptive statistics**

"Not surprisingly, a majority of firms have only one CEO: 63% of firms and 80% of firm-years belong to this category. One quarter of firms had two CEOs while 13% at least three CEOs. This latter category comprises only 3% of firm-years. CEO spell lengths follow an exponential distribution with a 20 percent annual hazard rate, implying typical tenures of 3-7 years."

**Message:** I initially found it hard to reconcile the statement that 80 % of firm-years come from single-CEO firms with the later remark that CEO spells have a 20 % annual hazard (mean ≈5 years). The apparent tension disappears once one realises that (i) the hazard is estimated on completed CEO spells, whereas the 63 %/80 % figures are unconditional firm-level counts over very heterogeneous observation windows, and (ii) entry and exit are pervasive, so most firms are observed for only a few years. It may nevertheless help readers if the text briefly specifies that the hazard rate is estimated on spell data and is not directly comparable to unconditional firm-level proportions.

## Comment 21

**Clarification on the sign of the covariance pre-trend**

"Covariance displays a milder upward pre-trend. Persistent shocks induce correlation between past outcomes and future estimated CEO effects even when no true CEO change occurs, because high future outcomes signal a growth trajectory that began before the pseudo-transition."

**Message:** At first the phrase “upward pre-trend” made me think the covariance was positive before the transition.  In fact, the simulation shows it is negative at early leads and simply increases (becomes less negative) as $t$ approaches –1.  Consider spelling this out explicitly—e.g., “the covariance is negative four years before, but slopes upward toward zero”—to avoid any risk of misinterpretation.

## Comment 22

**Clarifying the fixed effect in the event-study model**

"We estimate
$$
\tilde r_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{\ell\in\{-4,-3,-2,0,1,2,3\}} \beta_{\ell}\,\mathbb 1\{t-g=\ell\} + \varepsilon_{it},
$$
... [[note: if a firm has more than two consecutive spells, we treat adjacent spell pairs as separate transitions; multiple transitions per firm are allowed but clustered at the firm level.]]"

**Message:** Because the subscript $i$ is used earlier to denote firms, its appearance in $\alpha_i$ may initially suggest a single firm fixed effect across all transitions.  Since the text later clarifies that each transition is treated as a separate “pseudo-firm” with its own intercept, consider adding a short note here to state explicitly that $i$ now indexes transitions (with standard-error clustering at the real-firm level).

## Comment 23

**Imprecise notation for the covariance matrix of CEO effects**

"The model is
\begin{equation}
\mathbf y_i = \mathbf z_i + \mathbf e_i
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf z_i']= \mathbf \Lambda_i=
\begin{bmatrix}
  \lambda_{i11}\otimes \mathbf{11}' & \lambda_{i12}\otimes \mathbf{11}'\\
  \lambda_{i12}\otimes \mathbf{11}' & \lambda_{i22}\otimes \mathbf{11}'
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf e_i']=0,
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf e_i\mathbf e_i']=\sigma_1\mathbf\Sigma
\end{equation}
for changing firms, and 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf z_i']= \mathbf \Lambda_i=
  \lambda_{i11}\otimes \mathbf{11}',
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf e_i']=0,
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf e_i\mathbf e_i']=\sigma_0\mathbf\Sigma
\end{equation}
for non-changing firms."

**Message:** I initially wondered whether the repeated use of the symbol $\mathbf{11}'$ in Equation (A.2) referred to the \emph{same} matrix of ones or to matrices whose dimensions vary across blocks of $\mathbf\Lambda_i$.  Because the upper-left, upper-right, and lower-right blocks are respectively $T_1\times T_1$, $T_1\times T_2$, and $T_2\times T_2$, the reader has to infer that $\mathbf{11}'$ is always the conformable matrix of ones for the block in which it appears (and that a similar convention applies in the non-changing-firm case).  A brief parenthetical remark—e.g.\ “$\mathbf{11}'$ denotes a ones matrix of matching dimension”—or introducing a symbol such as $\mathbf J_{r,c}=\mathbf 1_r\mathbf 1_c'$ would remove this momentary ambiguity.

## Comment 24

**Unclear presentation of Monte Carlo scenarios in Figure 1**

"Figure 1 displays the results of six Monte Carlo scenarios..."

**Message:** Figure 1 contains three panels for variance and three panels for covariance, but the text describes six scenarios. It is unclear which three of the six scenarios are displayed in the figure and why the other three are omitted. The selection criteria should be stated explicitly so readers understand which complications are being illustrated graphically.

## Comment 25

**Omission of firm fixed effects from the model and simulations**

"Let firm $i$ in year $t$ have outcome $y_{it} = z_{m(i,t)} + e_{it}$..."

**Message:** The model as written includes only CEO fixed effects $z_{m(i,t)}$ and errors $e_{it}$, but the empirical implementation estimates a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) specification that includes both firm and CEO effects. If firm fixed effects are part of the estimation procedure, the Monte Carlo simulations should generate data with a nontrivial variance-covariance structure between firm and CEO effects to match the empirical design. Alternatively, the theoretical sections could present the single-FE model and note that the application uses TWFE as in Kline (2020), where one application employs TWFE while the general framework remains broader. Clarifying whether the firm fixed effect is integral to the theory or specific to the application would strengthen the exposition.

## Comment 26

**Overstated difficulty of implementing existing corrections**

"while powerful, these require estimating many components and rederiving formulas for each target second moment)."

**Message:** The statement that existing corrections such as the Andrews (2008) analytical adjustment or the Bonhomme et al. (2019) clustering approach "require estimating many components and rederiving formulas" may overstate their implementation complexity. The Andrews correction for homoskedastic, i.i.d. errors is straightforward to implement, and the Bonhomme clustering approach requires only grouping based on a wage distribution in addition to standard TWFE. It would help to be more precise about which aspects of these methods are burdensome or to clarify that the statement refers to settings with persistent, heteroskedastic errors where analytical adjustments become more involved.

## Comment 27

**Removed sentence on limited mobility bias may aid focus**

"A special case in worker-firm studies is limited mobility bias \citep{andrews2008high}, which arises when workers do not move frequently across firms."

**Message:** This sentence was removed because, in a CEO-firm setting without worker-firm mobility data, the reference to limited mobility bias in worker-firm studies risks diverting attention from the core contribution. The bias addressed in this paper affects the estimated variance of CEO (worker) fixed effects, whereas limited mobility bias in the Andrews (2008) sense affects the firm fixed effect estimates. Although the two biases are formally similar under the same TWFE framework, the distinct contexts and affected parameters justify focusing the exposition on the CEO application. The removal clarifies the scope.

## Comment 28

**Insufficient motivation for why the proposed method is necessary**

"Our debiasing approach requires only the proportional-autocovariance assumption and a placebo sample..."

**Message:** The current draft demonstrates that the proposed placebo-debiasing method is feasible and works in simulations, but it does not sufficiently explain why it is necessary relative to existing approaches. Kline (2020, p. 1869) and Kline (2024, p. 156) outline when each correction is appropriate: the Andrews (2008) analytical correction works under homoskedastic, independent errors; leave-one-out connected sets (Kline et al., 2020) are powerful but drop many observations in limited-mobility settings such as manager data; clustering (Bonhomme et al., 2019; Kline, 2024) imposes additional structure on the distribution of fixed effects; and cross-fitting has its own requirements. The placebo approach requires less structure than clustering and retains more observations than leave-one-out, but this comparative advantage should be stated explicitly. Adding a paragraph that systematically contrasts the data and modeling requirements of each method—perhaps in a table or bulleted list—would clarify the method's niche and improve its perceived contribution.

## Comment 29

**Inconsistent comparison to prior literature on manager effect magnitudes**

"evidence from public sector organizations suggests modest manager effects (fenizia2022, janke 2024), (....) Our results fall between these extremes..."

**Message:** The text positions the findings as falling "between extremes," citing Fenizia (2022) as an example of modest manager effects. Fenizia reports that a one-standard-deviation increase in managerial talent raises office productivity by 10 percent. It is not immediately clear whether this estimate is small relative to the current paper's results or comparable in magnitude. If the 10 percent figure translates to a variance share or $R^2$ that is similar to the estimates reported here, the characterization as an "extreme" may be inaccurate. Please verify the numerical comparison and either reframe the contrast or provide sufficient detail (e.g., converting Fenizia's coefficient to an implied variance share) so readers can assess the magnitude claim directly.
