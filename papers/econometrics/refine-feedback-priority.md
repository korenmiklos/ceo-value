## Comment 1

**Mismatch in description of Figure panels**

"Variance Decomposition by Firm Age (Panel D). Using the estimated variance of CEO fixed effects, we can compute how much CEOs contribute to revenue variance by firm age. Assuming that each CEO change adds the same variance to log revenue, we can back out the variance of CEO effects by age group. As firms age, they accumulate revenue shocks (red), but they also tend to change CEOs more often (blue). Over time, about a tenth of revenue variance is explained by CEO effects. This is smaller than the $R^2$ reported in Panel C because older firms have more accumulated shocks, diluting the relative contribution of CEOs."

**Message:** In the Results section the prose refers to six panels (A–F) and assigns content to each, yet the caption of Figure \ref{fig:application} lists only four panels (A–D) and uses a different ordering (e.g., caption: Panel B = $R^{2}$, Panel C = covariance; text: Panel B = covariance, Panel C = $R^{2}$).  The text also describes a “Variance Decomposition by Firm Age” as Panel D, whereas the caption states that Panel D contains regression coefficients.  Because the figure is central to the empirical argument, please ensure that the number, ordering, and labelling of panels are consistent across the figure file, its caption, and the accompanying paragraphs so that readers can unambiguously match each statistic to its graphical representation.

## Comment 2

**Mismatch between figure caption and text for Figure `fig:application`**

"Notes: Event studies of log revenue around CEO transitions. All panels normalize to year $t=-1$ (one year before CEO arrival). Panel A shows the variance of revenue changes from baseline. Panel B displays the fraction of revenue variance explained by CEO fixed effects (R-squared). Panel C plots the covariance of revenue change with the change in CEO fixed effect. Panel D shows regression coefficients from projecting revenue on CEO effects."

**Message:** Figure `fig:application` and the surrounding text use different panel labels.  
• The caption lists four panels (A–D) and assigns Panel B to the R-squared plot and Panel C to the covariance plot.  
• The Results section immediately afterward discusses six panels (A–F), assigns Panel B to the covariance plot and Panel C to the R-squared plot, and refers to Panels E and F that the caption never describes.  

Because Figure `fig:application` is central to the empirical results, this mismatch makes it hard to follow which graph the text is interpreting. Please ensure that the caption, figure labels, and paragraph headings use a single, consistent set of panel designations.

## Comment 3

**Explanation of bias with i.i.d. shocks**

"Together, the slope can be biased up or down depending on the balance between these terms. With i.i.d. shocks and long, balanced spells, $\Cov(\varepsilon_i,\eta_i)\approx 0$ and $\Var(\eta_i)$ is small. Both components are small-sample phenomena driven by short $T_1$ and $T_2$. As $T_1,T_2\to\infty$, spell means average out shocks so both bias terms vanish."

**Message:** The paragraph might leave readers with the impression that, even under i.i.d.\ shocks, the naive slope remains biased until spells become long.  In fact, when $\Sigma=\mathbf I$ we have $\Cov(\varepsilon_i,\eta_i)=\Var(\eta_i)$ for any $T_1,T_2$, so the fraction
\[
\hat\beta=\frac{\lambda_i+\Cov(\varepsilon_i,\eta_i)}
                {\lambda_i+\Var(\eta_i)}
\]
simplifies to $\hat\beta=1$ exactly, even in very short panels.  It would help to add a clause noting this exact cancellation and to clarify that the need for long, balanced spells arises only for the bias terms themselves to shrink toward zero, not for the slope to be unbiased.

## Comment 4

**Mismatch between Monte Carlo summary and detailed results**

"We illustrate our method in Monte Carlo experiments that vary the severity of the bias problem across three scenarios: a baseline with balanced panels and independent shocks, extension to persistent shocks, and allowing for a difference up to a scalar of the error structure between the treated and control groups. ... When we allow for persistent shocks and a level difference between the variance-covariance matrix of the treated and control groups, the naive standard deviation of the CEO effect is upward biased by 28 percent."

**Message:** There appears to be a numerical inconsistency between the introduction’s Monte-Carlo summary and Table 1.  
The text says that, when both persistent shocks and an overall scale difference in the error variance are introduced, “the naïve standard deviation of the CEO effect is upward biased by 28 percent.”  
The only simulation that combines those two features is the “All Complications” column, where the naïve variance of Δẑ is 2.552.  With a true variance of 1, this implies a naïve standard deviation of about 1.60—an upward bias of roughly 60 percent, not 28 percent.  No other column delivers a 28 percent SD bias either.  Please check whether (i) the introductory sentence is referring to a different scenario than the one reported in the table, or (ii) the percentage in the prose needs to be updated.

## Comment 5

**Contradiction in CEO identification and sample selection rules**

"Finding CEOs among all individuals from the data requires heuristics since job titles are inconsistently recorded. When explicit ``managing director'' titles exist, we use them directly. For remaining cases, we assume all representatives are CEOs if three or fewer exist at the firm. ... We apply several restrictions to create a sample suitable for productivity analysis. First, we exclude mining and finance sectors due to specialized accounting frameworks and regulatory environments. Second, we drop firms ever having more than 2 simultaneous CEOs to avoid complex governance structures that complicate identification."

**Message:** At first glance the “three or fewer” identification rule seems to conflict with the later restriction that drops firms with “more than 2 simultaneous CEOs.”  Because the first rule is applied only at the raw-registry parsing stage, while the second governs the cleaned analysis sample, there is in fact no contradiction—observations with three concurrent representatives are identified but later excluded.  

A separate, more substantive point remains.  The final sample can contain firm-years with exactly two simultaneous CEOs, yet the core model $y_{it}=z_{m(i,t)}+e_{it}$ presumes a single manager identifier per firm-year.  The draft does not explain how such cases are handled—whether one CEO is selected, the pair is treated as a joint “CEO team,” or the observations are otherwise adjusted.  Clarifying this handling would strengthen transparency and replicability.

## Comment 6

**Omission of scaling factor in debiasing formulas**

"Debiased moments.} Subtracting the placebo moments from the treated moments yields debiased estimates:
\begin{align}
\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) &= \widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{tr}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) - \widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i),\\
\widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta \hat z_i) &= \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{tr}}(\Delta \hat z_i) - \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta \hat z_i).
\end{align}
For nonlinear transformations such as regression slopes or correlations, we first debias the underlying variances and covariances, then form the ratio:
\begin{equation}
\hat\beta^{\text{db}} = \frac{\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i)}{\widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta \hat z_i)}.
\end{equation}"

**Message:** The equations in the “Debiased moments” subsection subtract placebo moments from treated moments without explicitly showing the variance-ratio multiplier $c=\hat\sigma_1^2/\hat\sigma_0^2$ that was introduced two paragraphs earlier.  Because the text states that placebo moments must be scaled by $c$ under the proportional-autocovariance assumption, it would help to signal in the display (e.g., with “$\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}$ already scaled by $\hat c$”) that the factor is embedded in the notation.  Otherwise readers may mistakenly infer that the formulas apply only to the special case $c=1$.

## Comment 7

**Explanation of unbiased OLS slope in baseline MC**

"The covariance of the revenue change at year $+2$ with the CEO effect is also upward biased in the naive estimate, but by exactly the same proportion as the variance. This proportional inflation occurs because when shocks are independent and identically distributed, the bias in both the numerator and denominator of the regression slope scales identically. As a consequence, the naive regression coefficient $\hat\beta_2$ is unbiased even though both its components are biased."

**Message:** The text attributes the near-unbiasedness of $\hat\beta_2$ in the baseline scenario to the covariance and variance being inflated “by exactly the same proportion.”  That exact identity holds only when the same linear contrast is used for both variables; here, $\Delta y_{+2}$ (a two-point change) and $\Delta\hat z$ (difference of spell means) rely on different weighting schemes.  Consistent with this, the reported biases—0.188 for the covariance and 0.172 for the variance—are similar but not identical.  The slope ends up almost unbiased, but the explanation overstates the theoretical equivalence.  Consider replacing “exactly the same proportion” with a more qualified statement (e.g., “very similar magnitudes, leading to a negligible slope bias”).

## Comment 8

**Inconsistency in Monte Carlo scenario description**

"The table lists scenario-specific parameters: maximum spell length $T_{\max}$, error autocorrelation $\rho$, error standard deviation in the treated group $\sigma(\epsilon_{\text{treated}})$, and the annual hazard of CEO change in the unbalanced panel scenarios. The \emph{baseline} calibration assumes short balanced spells and i.i.d. errors. Columns (2) to (5) introduce one complication at a time."

**Message:** The table note states that columns (2)–(5) each “introduce one complication at a time” relative to the baseline.  Column (4) (“Unbalanced Panel”), however, changes two parameters: it introduces an annual CEO-change hazard of 0.20 \emph{and} sets $\rho=0.90$ instead of the baseline value 0.00.  As written, the note suggests that the scenario isolates the impact of unbalanced panels, whereas it actually combines unbalanced spells with persistent errors.  Please revise either the parameter row (if $\rho$ should be 0) or the wording of the note to make the intended design clear.

## Comment 9

**Clarity of the subtraction step in the introduction**

"The proportional autocovariance assumption then implies that the bias terms are the same up to a scalar. And because covariance is a bilinear operator and variance is additive under strict exogeneity, the bias terms can be ``precomputed'' in the placebo group and simply subtracted from the treated moments."

**Message:** The sentence “the bias terms can be … ‘precomputed’ in the placebo group and simply subtracted from the treated moments” could be read as implying that subtraction is performed without first applying the scalar factor mentioned in the previous line.  To avoid possible confusion, it would help to state explicitly that the placebo moment is first multiplied by this factor (denoted $c$ later in the paper) and then subtracted.

## Comment 10

**Inconsistent description of figure panels**

"Figure \ref{fig:application} displays four key moments around CEO arrivals: variance of revenue changes (Panel A), the share of revenue variance explained by CEO transitions (Panel B), covariance of revenue with CEO effects (Panel C), and regression coefficients (Panel D)."

**Message:** The introductory sentence mislabels the panels: later text makes clear that Panel B shows the covariance of revenue with CEO effects and Panel C shows the share of variance explained, not the reverse. It also refers to only four panels, while Panels E and F are discussed immediately afterwards. Revising the panel references in this sentence will align the overview with the detailed descriptions and the figure itself.

## Comment 11

**Ambiguity in the strict exogeneity assumption (sec:The Econometric Problem)**

"Let firm $i$ in year $t$ have outcome
\begin{equation}\label{eq:model1}
  y_{it} = z_{m(i,t)} + e_{it},\qquad \mathbb E[e_{it}|z_{is}]=0,
\end{equation}
where $z_{m(i,t)}$ collects the CEO effect at time $t$ and $e_{it}$ is a shock. We assume that $z_{m(i,t)}$ is piecewise constant, changing only when the CEO changes and that $e_{it}$ is mean independent of the CEO path for all $s$ (``strict exogeneity'' or ``random mobility'')."

**Message:** Statement (1) $\mathbb{E}[e_{it}\mid z_{is}]=0$ could, if read literally, be interpreted as conditioning on a single-period CEO effect rather than on the entire sequence of CEO assignments.  At first this made me think the assumption might be weaker than strict exogeneity.  Then I understood from the surrounding sentence (“mean independent of the CEO path for all $s$”) that the intended condition is $\mathbb{E}[e_{it}\mid\{z_{is}\}_{s=1}^T]=0$.  Consider writing the conditioning set explicitly—e.g.\ $\mathbb{E}[e_{it}\mid\mathbf z_i]=0$ or $\mathbb{E}[e_{it}\mid\{m(i,\tau)\}_\tau]=0$—to avoid any possibility of misinterpretation.

## Comment 12

**Imprecise notation in unbiasedness claim (sec:The Econometric Problem)**

"where $T_n$ is the number of observations with CEO $n$. The estimator is unbiased because $\mathbb E[\hat z_n|z_n] = z_n$. The estimator, however, is only consistent as $T_n\to\infty$, that is, as the number of observations per CEO grows large."

**Message:** Statement $\mathbb{E}[\hat z_n\mid z_n]=z_n$ is correct under a fixed-effects interpretation, but seeing $z_n$ both as the conditioning variable and as the parameter being recovered can be momentarily confusing.  Writing either $\mathbb{E}[\hat z_n]=z_n$ (treating $z_n$ as fixed) or $\mathbb{E}[\hat z_n\mid\mathbf z]=z_n$ (conditioning on the full vector of true effects) would make the unbiasedness claim more transparent.

## Comment 13

**Clarification on the object of interest in the covariance expectation**

"Under the model assumptions, these moments have the expectation
\begin{align}
\mathbb E\widehat{\Cov}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) &= \Bar\lambda + A,\\
\mathbb E\widehat{\Var}(\Delta \hat z_i) &= \Bar\lambda + B,
\end{align}
where $\Bar\lambda$ is the average variance of true CEO effect changes across groups (the object of interest), and $A$ and $B$ are \emph{bias terms} that depend on the spell-length distributions, event-window designs, and the autocovariance structure of shocks."

**Message:** Statement (3) is correct for the class of contrasts the paper studies, namely pre–post \emph{differences} in outcomes for which the signal component satisfies $\Delta y_i^{\text{signal}}=\Delta z_i$.  Under this restriction $\Cov(\Delta y_i^{\text{signal}},\Delta z_i)=\Var(\Delta z_i)$, so the same parameter $\bar\lambda$ legitimately appears in both equations (3) and (4).  Because this zero-sum property is explicit only in the example and in Appendix A (where the weight vector $\mathbf w$ obeys $\mathbf w'\mathbf 1=0$), consider adding a brief sentence in the main text to remind readers that “general linear contrast” always refers to a pre–post difference with weights summing to zero.  This would pre-empt the impression that equation (3) covers arbitrary contrasts.

## Comment 14

**Omission of scaling factor in debiasing formulas**

"Debiased moments.} Subtracting the placebo moments from the treated moments yields debiased estimates:
\begin{align}
\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) &= \widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{tr}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) - \widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i),\\
\widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{db}}(\Delta \hat z_i) &= \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{tr}}(\Delta \hat z_i) - \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta \hat z_i).
\end{align}"

**Message:** I initially had trouble with the “Debiased moments” formulas because, read literally, they appear to subtract the raw placebo moments even when the proportional-autocovariance assumption implies a variance-ratio scaling. Only after re-reading the preceding paragraph did I understand that the authors intend $\widehat{\Cov}^{\text{pl}}$ and $\widehat{\Var}^{\text{pl}}$ to denote the placebo moments \emph{after} multiplication by the estimated variance ratio. To spare readers the same detour, consider adding a sentence clarifying that the symbols with the “pl” superscript refer to the placebo moments \emph{already rescaled} by $\hat c=\sigma_1^{2}/\sigma_0^{2}$.

## Comment 15

**Ambiguity in the definition of bias terms A and B**

"The key insight is that for placebo transitions, there is no true CEO effect change: $\Delta z_i = 0$ for all placebo firms. Yet the placebo sample has the same spell-length distribution and event-window design as the treated sample. Therefore, the placebo moments recover the bias terms:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta y_i,\Delta \hat z_i) \xrightarrow{p} A,\qquad \widehat{\Var}^{\,\text{pl}}(\Delta \hat z_i) \xrightarrow{p} B.
\end{equation}"

**Message:** The same symbols $A$ and $B$ are used for the bias terms in both the treated and the placebo samples. Because the proportional-autocovariance assumption implies $A_{\text{tr}} = c\,A_{\text{pl}}$ and $B_{\text{tr}} = c\,B_{\text{pl}}$, employing identical notation can obscure which version of the bias a given sentence is referring to. Introducing subscripts (e.g., $A_{\mathrm{pl}}, B_{\mathrm{pl}}$ versus $A_{\mathrm{tr}}, B_{\mathrm{tr}}$) or adding a brief explanatory sentence would make the progression of the argument easier to follow.

## Comment 16

**Explanation for changing slope bias in unbalanced panels**

"Post-arrival dynamics look less gradual than under persistence alone, plausibly because typical spells are shorter in unbalanced panels, leaving less time for any gradual buildup to manifest."

**Message:** Statement “Post-arrival dynamics look less gradual … leaving less time for any gradual buildup to manifest” briefly puzzled me because the paper elsewhere stresses that the “gradual buildup” in the naïve profile is a biased artefact, not a real dynamic effect.  After rereading the preceding paragraphs I realised the authors are still talking about the biased naïve pattern and are simply offering an intuitive reason – shorter average spells change the weighting of shocks in the bias terms – for why that pattern weakens in the unbalanced-panel scenario.  The explanation is correct, but you might consider adding a clause such as “in the naïve estimates” to make it unmistakable that the reference is to the spurious, not the true, dynamics.

## Comment 17

**Ambiguous notation for industry and spell**

"Concretely, let \(r_{it}\) denote firm revenue and let \(\tilde r_{it}=r_{it}-\bar r_{st}\) be revenue demeaned by industry–year \((s,t)\) cells. Let \(\mathbb 1\{\text{spell}=s\}\) indicate the A or B spell. The spell effect is
\begin{equation}
\hat z_{is} = \frac{1}{T_{is}}\sum_{t\in s} \tilde r_{it},\qquad s\in\{A,B\}.
\end{equation}"

**Message:** At first the symbol $s$ looks overloaded: in $\bar r_{st}$ it serves as the industry index inside the industry–year mean, while in the very next sentence $s\in\{A,B\}$ labels the two CEO spells. Because the first $s$ is bound within the demeaning operator, a careful reader will realize the two meanings never interact, yet the immediate juxtaposition can still slow the reader down. Consider using different letters for industry and spell to keep the exposition friction-free.

---

## Comment 18

**Clarification of spell definition for CEO effects**

"For each transition from CEO A to CEO B, let the firm have two consecutive spells covering the entire tenures of A and B (not just the event window). We estimate a spell-level CEO effect as the within-spell mean of demeaned revenue."

**Message:** Readers accustomed to event studies that use fixed, symmetric windows might wonder why the spell effect $\hat z_{is}$ is averaged over the CEO’s entire tenure. A short reminder that the bias the paper corrects is a function of the actual spell length—already explained in Section 2—would make the rationale for this design choice immediately transparent.

---

## Comment 19

**Clarification on scaling placebo moments**

"Because the design matrices and weights are the same by construction, and because we assume the error autocovariance (Σ) is the same up to a scalar between treated and placebo groups, the covariance and variance bias components can be "precomputed" in the placebo sample and subtracted from the treated estimates. This delivers debiased variance of Δ ĥz and debiased event-study coefficients β<sub>ℓ</sub>."

**Message:** Statement that the placebo moments are “precomputed … and subtracted” could momentarily make a new reader wonder whether the scalar implied by the proportional-autocovariance assumption is being applied.  Since Section 3 already defines the debiasing formulas with the factor $c$ (e.g.\ $\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{tr}}-c\,\widehat{\Cov}^{\,\text{pl}}$), the procedure is correct; but adding a short reminder that the placebo moments are first multiplied by the estimated variance ratio would remove any possible ambiguity.

---

## Comment 20

**Apparent tension in sample descriptive statistics**

"Not surprisingly, a majority of firms have only one CEO: 63% of firms and 80% of firm-years belong to this category. One quarter of firms had two CEOs while 13% at least three CEOs. This latter category comprises only 3% of firm-years. CEO spell lengths follow an exponential distribution with a 20 percent annual hazard rate, implying typical tenures of 3-7 years."

**Message:** I initially found it hard to reconcile the statement that 80 % of firm-years come from single-CEO firms with the later remark that CEO spells have a 20 % annual hazard (mean ≈5 years). The apparent tension disappears once one realises that (i) the hazard is estimated on completed CEO spells, whereas the 63 %/80 % figures are unconditional firm-level counts over very heterogeneous observation windows, and (ii) entry and exit are pervasive, so most firms are observed for only a few years. It may nevertheless help readers if the text briefly specifies that the hazard rate is estimated on spell data and is not directly comparable to unconditional firm-level proportions.

---

## Comment 21

**Clarification on the sign of the covariance pre-trend**

"Covariance displays a milder upward pre-trend. Persistent shocks induce correlation between past outcomes and future estimated CEO effects even when no true CEO change occurs, because high future outcomes signal a growth trajectory that began before the pseudo-transition."

**Message:** At first the phrase “upward pre-trend” made me think the covariance was positive before the transition.  In fact, the simulation shows it is negative at early leads and simply increases (becomes less negative) as $t$ approaches –1.  Consider spelling this out explicitly—e.g., “the covariance is negative four years before, but slopes upward toward zero”—to avoid any risk of misinterpretation.

---

## Comment 22

**Clarifying the fixed effect in the event-study model**

"We estimate
$$
\tilde r_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{\ell\in\{-4,-3,-2,0,1,2,3\}} \beta_{\ell}\,\mathbb 1\{t-g=\ell\} + \varepsilon_{it},
$$
... [[note: if a firm has more than two consecutive spells, we treat adjacent spell pairs as separate transitions; multiple transitions per firm are allowed but clustered at the firm level.]]"

**Message:** Because the subscript $i$ is used earlier to denote firms, its appearance in $\alpha_i$ may initially suggest a single firm fixed effect across all transitions.  Since the text later clarifies that each transition is treated as a separate “pseudo-firm” with its own intercept, consider adding a short note here to state explicitly that $i$ now indexes transitions (with standard-error clustering at the real-firm level).

---

## Comment 23

**Imprecise notation for the covariance matrix of CEO effects**

"The model is
\begin{equation}
\mathbf y_i = \mathbf z_i + \mathbf e_i
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf z_i']= \mathbf \Lambda_i=
\begin{bmatrix}
  \lambda_{i11}\otimes \mathbf{11}' & \lambda_{i12}\otimes \mathbf{11}'\\
  \lambda_{i12}\otimes \mathbf{11}' & \lambda_{i22}\otimes \mathbf{11}'
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf e_i']=0,
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf e_i\mathbf e_i']=\sigma_1\mathbf\Sigma
\end{equation}
for changing firms, and 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf z_i']= \mathbf \Lambda_i=
  \lambda_{i11}\otimes \mathbf{11}',
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf z_i\mathbf e_i']=0,
\qquad \mathbb E[\mathbf e_i\mathbf e_i']=\sigma_0\mathbf\Sigma
\end{equation}
for non-changing firms."

**Message:** I initially wondered whether the repeated use of the symbol $\mathbf{11}'$ in Equation (A.2) referred to the \emph{same} matrix of ones or to matrices whose dimensions vary across blocks of $\mathbf\Lambda_i$.  Because the upper-left, upper-right, and lower-right blocks are respectively $T_1\times T_1$, $T_1\times T_2$, and $T_2\times T_2$, the reader has to infer that $\mathbf{11}'$ is always the conformable matrix of ones for the block in which it appears (and that a similar convention applies in the non-changing-firm case).  A brief parenthetical remark—e.g.\ “$\mathbf{11}'$ denotes a ones matrix of matching dimension”—or introducing a symbol such as $\mathbf J_{r,c}=\mathbf 1_r\mathbf 1_c'$ would remove this momentary ambiguity.
