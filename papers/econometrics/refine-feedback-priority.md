**Contradiction in CEO identification and sample selection rules**

"Finding CEOs among all individuals from the data requires heuristics since job titles are inconsistently recorded. When explicit ``managing director'' titles exist, we use them directly. For remaining cases, we assume all representatives are CEOs if three or fewer exist at the firm. ... We apply several restrictions to create a sample suitable for productivity analysis. First, we exclude mining and finance sectors due to specialized accounting frameworks and regulatory environments. Second, we drop firms ever having more than 2 simultaneous CEOs to avoid complex governance structures that complicate identification."

**Message:** At first glance the “three or fewer” identification rule seems to conflict with the later restriction that drops firms with “more than 2 simultaneous CEOs.”  Because the first rule is applied only at the raw-registry parsing stage, while the second governs the cleaned analysis sample, there is in fact no contradiction—observations with three concurrent representatives are identified but later excluded.  

A separate, more substantive point remains.  The final sample can contain firm-years with exactly two simultaneous CEOs, yet the core model $y_{it}=z_{m(i,t)}+e_{it}$ presumes a single manager identifier per firm-year.  The draft does not explain how such cases are handled—whether one CEO is selected, the pair is treated as a joint “CEO team,” or the observations are otherwise adjusted.  Clarifying this handling would strengthen transparency and replicability.




## Comment 17

**Ambiguous notation for industry and spell**

"Concretely, let \(r_{it}\) denote firm revenue and let \(\tilde r_{it}=r_{it}-\bar r_{st}\) be revenue demeaned by industry–year \((s,t)\) cells. Let \(\mathbb 1\{\text{spell}=s\}\) indicate the A or B spell. The spell effect is
\begin{equation}
\hat z_{is} = \frac{1}{T_{is}}\sum_{t\in s} \tilde r_{it},\qquad s\in\{A,B\}.
\end{equation}"

**Message:** At first the symbol $s$ looks overloaded: in $\bar r_{st}$ it serves as the industry index inside the industry–year mean, while in the very next sentence $s\in\{A,B\}$ labels the two CEO spells. Because the first $s$ is bound within the demeaning operator, a careful reader will realize the two meanings never interact, yet the immediate juxtaposition can still slow the reader down. Consider using different letters for industry and spell to keep the exposition friction-free.

**Clarification of spell definition for CEO effects**

"For each transition from CEO A to CEO B, let the firm have two consecutive spells covering the entire tenures of A and B (not just the event window). We estimate a spell-level CEO effect as the within-spell mean of demeaned revenue."

**Message:** Readers accustomed to event studies that use fixed, symmetric windows might wonder why the spell effect $\hat z_{is}$ is averaged over the CEO’s entire tenure. A short reminder that the bias the paper corrects is a function of the actual spell length—already explained in Section 2—would make the rationale for this design choice immediately transparent.
