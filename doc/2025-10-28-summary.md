# CEO Value Project Meeting Summary - October 28, 2025

## Current Status and Critical Issues

### Word Count Problem (URGENT)
- **Current**: 8,000 words (9,600 with everything included)
- **Target**: 6,400 words for 3 exhibits
- **Required reduction**: 1,600 words (20% cut)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Main text without appendix: 7,200 words
  - Mathematical equations: ~370 words
  - Appendix: ~800 words

### Submission Timeline
- **Deadline**: 2.5 days remaining
- **Tonight**: Transfer to Krisztina for editing
- **Tomorrow**: Complete exhibit revisions

## Technical Decisions Made

### Monte Carlo Figure Redesign (Figure 1)
**New Structure**: 4-6 panels showing variance and covariance
- **Row 1**: Baseline (no excess variance in Monte Carlo)
  - Show treated vs. control groups (not naive vs. debiased)
  - Demonstrate variance jump after manager arrival
  - Show pre-trend in covariance
- **Row 2**: With excess variance added to treated group
  - Demonstrates need for excess variance correction
- **Implementation time**: Max 1 hour

### Table Modifications
- **Add covariance row** to existing tables
- **Key finding**: When ρ=0 (no autocorrelation), variance and covariance bias are equal
- **Move all exhibits** to end of document for word count

### Core Methodological Points to Preserve
- **Placebo-controlled design**: Novel approach separating true CEO effects from noise
- **Key result**: 75% of apparent CEO effects are spurious
- **True causal effect**: 5.5% (only 25% of raw 22.5% correlation)
- **Validation**: Aligns with Gaure (2014), Bonhomme et al. (2023), Andrews et al. (2008)

## Word Reduction Strategy

### Immediate Actions
1. **Remove AI verbosity**: Overly smooth, repetitive text
2. **Simplify notation**:
   - CEO → A
   - FIRM → B  
   - Variance Decomposition → VARDEC
3. **Condense results discussion** (currently unedited AI transcription)
4. **Shorten abstract**: Target 100 words (currently ~200)

### Text Sections to Focus On
- Results explanation (major cuts needed)
- Methodology description (remove redundancy)
- Introduction (tighten references)

## Division of Labor

### Miklós (Today/Tomorrow Morning)
- Complete 3 exhibit revisions for CEO Value
- Add covariance to tables
- Simplify Monte Carlo figures
- Reduce verbosity in results sections

### Colleague
- Review and tighten introduction
- Ensure consistency with econometrics description
- Add missing citations

### Krisztina
- Receive text tonight for language editing
- Focus on removing filler words and repetition
- Final polish if time permits

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Exhibits (Final Count: 3)
1. **Monte Carlo validation** figure (revised)
2. **Event study** results (combined table/figure)
3. **Application** results table

### Key Sections Needing Attention
- Estimating CEO spell effects (remove verbose equations)
- Monte Carlo explanation (streamline to essentials)
- Results interpretation (completely rewrite)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Priority**: Get under word limit even if cutting aggressively
- **Fallback**: Can expand in revision if accepted
- **Critical preserve**: Core methodology and key findings

## Next 48 Hours Schedule
- **Tonight**: Transfer to Krisztina, continue cutting
- **Tomorrow AM**: Exhibit completion
- **Tomorrow PM**: Integration and final cuts
- **Wednesday**: Final review and submission prep
