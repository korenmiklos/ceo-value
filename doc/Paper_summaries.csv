GompersKaplanMukharlyamov2023,The Market for CEOs: Evidence from Private Equity,"How active is the CEO labor market in large PE-backed buyouts, and who gets hired?","U.S. LBOs with enterprise value > $1B (2010–2016), 192 deals; PitchBook-based sample.",Descriptive analysis + comparisons; estimate CEO comp from PE performance; some regressions on hiring likelihood.,~71% replace CEO; >75% of new CEOs external (67% complete outsiders). Buyout CEO comp > similar-sized public firms and ≈S&P500 CEOs; little relation between pre-buyout performance and hiring outsiders.,Suggests transferable/industry-specific rather than firm-specific human capital; active CEO market.
Brander2021-cr,Comparing CEO compensation effects of public and private acquisitions,Does acquisition performance and activity affect CEO pay differently for public- vs private-target deals?,"S&P 1500 U.S. acquirers, 1992–2016; ExecuComp + SDC + CRSP.","Panel regressions (fixed/random effects), event-study abnormal returns as performance; IV robustness.","Private-target announcement returns significantly increase CEO pay; public-target returns insignificant. More acquisitions raise CEO pay for both, larger for public-target deals.",Supports stronger agency effects in public acquisitions; robust across specifications.
Gao2015-bw,A comparison of CEO pay–performance sensitivity in privately-held and public firms,How does CEO pay level and pay–performance sensitivity differ between private and public firms?,"U.S. private & public firms, 1999–2011; unique dataset combining private-firm compensation with public data.",Cross-sectional and panel regressions; selection controls; examine ownership/liquidity/market discipline as mediators.,"Public-firm CEOs paid ≈30% more. Pay relates to accounting performance in both, but sensitivity much weaker in private firms; concentrated ownership substitutes for incentive pay.","Robust to self-selection and institutional differences (ownership, ESOPs, liquidity, takeover pressure)."
Page2018-pm,"CEO attributes, compensation, and firm value: Evidence from a structural estimation",Which CEO attributes drive compensation and shareholder value?,U.S. public firms; JFE 2018; model estimated on exec/firm data.,"Dynamic structural model (moral hazard) estimating risk aversion, board influence, effort; counterfactuals.",Attributes explain most pay variation but little firm value. Removing CEO influence: +1.7% value; making CEOs risk-neutral: +16%; removing all agency frictions: +29%.,Agency frictions are first-order; structural approach complements reduced-form work.
Quigley2022-dq,Does the CEO effect on performance differ in private versus public firms?,Is the variance in firm performance attributable to CEOs larger in private firms than public firms?,"Large Swedish firms (public & private), 1997–2013; Statistics Sweden; Strategic Organization 2022.","Variance decomposition of CEO effects with panel models; matched-pair analysis controlling for industry, size, profitability.",CEO effect larger in private firms: ~7–11 pp more variance explained; private CEOs show wider performance dispersion and slightly better averages.,"Private firms: less slack, higher leverage; yet larger CEO effect—consistent with greater discretion/constraints interplay."
ColeMehran2008,What Can We Learn from Privately Held Firms about Executive Compensation?,What determines CEO pay in privately held firms and how does it compare to public firms?,U.S. privately held firms (NSSBF 1993) matched to public-firm data; FRBNY Staff Report 314 (2008).,"Cross-sectional regressions of CEO pay on size, org form (C vs S corp), CEO traits, leverage; compare elasticities to public firms.",Pay–size elasticity much larger in private firms; C‑corp executives paid more; CEO pay inversely related to ownership and leverage; education ↗ pay; female CEOs paid less.,Tax incentives and ownership structure shape pay mix; limited stock-based comp in sample period.
Nakazato2011-jf,Executive compensation in Japan: Estimating levels and determinants from tax records,How high are Japanese CEO incomes and what determines them?,Japan; CEOs of TSE Section 1 firms in 2004; high-income taxpayer list matched to CEOs plus firm data.,Tobit regressions on total income from tax data; compare to U.S.; governance correlates.,"Japanese executives earn ~1/5 of U.S. pay (size-adjusted); pay depends on firm size (~0.22 elasticity) and accounting profitability, not stock returns; family/blockholder firms pay less to non-family CEOs; board tenure linked to lower pay.",Uses tax liabilities to proxy total income (captures non‑corporate sources).
