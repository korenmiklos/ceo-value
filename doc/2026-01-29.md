# Research Discussion Summary: CEO Value Descriptive Statistics

**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Participants:** Corra971407, Krisztinaorban, Miklos, Telegdya
**Topic:** Descriptive statistics and measurement issues for the CEO value paper

## Overview

This meeting focused on refining the descriptive statistics and resolving measurement issues in the balance sheet and CEO registry data. The discussion covered accounting data quality problems, appropriate performance measures, sample construction criteria, and event study design considerations. Key themes included handling negative equity values, choosing appropriate profitability measures, defining CEO spells, and structuring the event study sample with treated and control groups.

## Data Quality and Measurement Issues

### Balance Sheet Variables

The team reviewed key balance sheet variables and their relationships:

- **Basic accounting identity**: Equity = Assets - Liabilities
- **Variable types**: Equity, total assets, total liabilities, tangible assets, intangible assets
- **Negative equity problem**: Many observations show negative equity values, which violates the theoretical lower bound for limited liability firms

The discussion identified that for limited liability companies, equity should have a lower bound of zero. Negative equity values in the data likely reflect either measurement error in the accounting data or firms operating outside the limited liability framework. This data quality issue requires careful handling in the analysis.

### Return on Assets (ROA) Definition

The group discussed multiple approaches to measuring firm performance:

- **ROA calculation**: Net income divided by total assets
- **Operating profit measure**: EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) per tangible assets as an alternative
- **Capital-normalized measures**: Operating profit or EBITDA scaled by tangible assets to focus on core business performance

The preference emerged for operating profit or EBITDA per tangible assets rather than standard ROA, as this better captures the core economic return on physical capital employed in the business. This approach also helps address the negative equity problem by focusing on flow measures rather than stock-based returns.

### Data Distribution Analysis

Discussion covered approaches for examining the raw distributions of key variables:

- **Histograms**: Plotting raw distributions to identify outliers and data quality issues
- **Percentile distributions**: Examining the distribution at different points (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles)
- **Outlier treatment**: Considering truncation or trimming of extreme values (e.g., winsorizing at 1st and 99th percentiles)
- **Weighted averages**: Computing asset-weighted averages to account for firm size heterogeneity

The team emphasized the importance of documenting these distributions before applying sample restrictions, as this provides transparency about data quality and the impact of filtering decisions.

## Empirical Research Design

### Revenue Regressions and Manager Value Estimation

The discussion covered the core econometric framework:

- **Revenue function estimation**: Regressing log revenue on capital, labor, materials, and wage bill with firm and industry-year fixed effects
- **Manager fixed effects**: Estimating manager-specific effects from the residualized revenue after controlling for inputs
- **Surplus calculation**: Constructing the surplus measure that serves as the basis for manager value estimation

This approach allows for separating the contribution of observable inputs from the manager-specific component that affects firm productivity.

### CEO Spell Construction

The team discussed how to define CEO spells and impose minimum spell length requirements:

- **CEO spell definition**: A continuous period during which the same person serves as CEO of a given firm
- **Minimum spell length**: Considering requirements such as minimum 2-3 years to ensure sufficient observations for reliable estimation
- **Switching years**: Recognizing that years when CEO transitions occur can be noisy and may require special treatment or exclusion

The spell-based approach differs from standard manager fixed effects by allowing the same manager to have different effects at different firms, reflecting match-specific quality or firm-manager complementarities.

### Event Study Sample Construction

Detailed discussion of how to construct the event study sample with appropriate treatment and control groups:

- **Universe of firms**: Starting with the full set of firms in the balance sheet data
- **Analysis sample restrictions**: Firms that reach at least 5 employees at some point (excludes very small businesses that may not maintain proper accounting records)
- **Switchers vs. non-switchers**: Distinguishing firms that experience CEO transitions from those with stable management
- **Treated group**: Firms with exactly one CEO change during the observation period (after applying the 5-employee filter)
- **Control group construction**: Firms that could potentially serve as controls, either because they never experience a CEO change or because they are assigned placebo transition dates

The event study design compares outcomes before and after actual CEO transitions (treated firms) to outcomes around placebo transition dates for control firms. This placebo-controlled approach helps separate true CEO effects from spurious correlations driven by time trends or firm lifecycle dynamics.

## Outcome Variables

The analysis will examine multiple outcome measures to characterize CEO effects comprehensively:

- **Revenue**: Primary outcome for estimating manager value (log scale)
- **Capital**: Physical capital stock (tangible assets)
- **Intangible assets**: Knowledge capital, brands, patents
- **Materials**: Intermediate input usage
- **Wage bill**: Total labor compensation (reflects both employment and wage levels)

Examining multiple outcomes provides a richer picture of how CEO transitions affect different aspects of firm operations and resource allocation.

## What We Agreed On

### Sample Definition
- Use the analysis sample with the 5-employee minimum threshold to focus on economically meaningful firms
- Exclude the very smallest firms (0-1 employees) that likely do not maintain proper accounting records
- Focus the event study on firms with exactly one CEO change to provide clean identification

### Measurement Approach
- Prefer operating profit or EBITDA per tangible assets over standard ROA to address data quality issues and focus on core business performance
- Document raw distributions with histograms and percentile statistics before applying filters
- Use asset-weighted averages when computing summary statistics to account for firm size heterogeneity

### Event Study Design
- Implement placebo-controlled event study comparing actual CEO transitions to placebo transitions
- Use event window from t=-4 to t=+3 years around transition with t=-1 as baseline
- Examine multiple outcomes (revenue, capital, intangibles, materials, wage bill) to characterize the full scope of CEO effects

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### Immediate Data Tasks
1. **Resolve negative equity issue**: Investigate the extent of negative equity observations, determine whether these reflect limited liability vs. unlimited liability firms, and decide on appropriate treatment (exclusion, separate analysis, or alternative measures)
2. **Compute EBITDA per tangible assets**: Calculate this preferred performance measure and examine its distribution
3. **Generate distribution plots**: Create histograms and percentile tables for key balance sheet variables and performance measures

### Sample Construction
1. **Document sample selection**: Create detailed tables showing how sample restrictions affect the number of firms and observations at each stage
2. **Characterize CEO spells**: Compute descriptive statistics on spell lengths, number of spells per manager, and number of managers per firm
3. **Define event study samples**: Precisely define treated and control groups, including rules for assigning placebo transition dates

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Revenue function estimation**: Run regressions with appropriate fixed effects and save results for Table 3
2. **Manager value estimation**: Compute manager fixed effects and examine their distribution across the connected component
3. **Event study estimation**: Implement the placebo-controlled event study for all outcome variables and samples

### Tables and Figures
1. **Table 1**: Update temporal distribution table if needed to reflect final sample definitions
2. **Table 3**: Finalize revenue function estimation results table
3. **Figure 2**: Create event study plots by CEO transition type
4. **Figure 3**: Create event study plots for different outcome variables

### Documentation
1. **Data quality note**: Document the negative equity issue and its implications in the appendix
2. **Measurement discussion**: Explain the choice of EBITDA per tangible assets over standard ROA
3. **Sample selection criteria**: Provide clear justification for the 5-employee threshold and other filters

## Technical Notes

- The project uses Stata for all data processing and econometric estimation
- Balance sheet data spans 1992-2022 from Hungarian administrative records
- CEO panel data provides firm-person-year structure for constructing CEO spells
- Network analysis (finding connected component) uses Julia but is not the main focus of descriptive statistics
- All descriptive statistics should be computed on the analysis sample after applying the 5-employee filter but before event study restrictions

## Unresolved Questions

- Exact treatment of negative equity observations: exclude entirely, analyze separately, or use alternative measures that avoid the equity variable?
- Minimum spell length requirement: what threshold provides sufficient observations while retaining adequate sample size?
- Placebo assignment rules: what specific algorithm should be used to assign placebo transition dates to control firms?
- Weighting approach: should all summary statistics use asset weights, employment weights, or unweighted counts?
- Outlier treatment: what percentiles should be used for winsorizing or trimming extreme values?
