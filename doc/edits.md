## Major Structural Issues

### 1. The Placebo Method Needs Earlier and Clearer Introduction

The paper buries its key innovation—the placebo-controlled approach—until Section 4.4. This is too late. Readers need to understand upfront that this is the paper's core methodological contribution.

Suggestion: Add a subsection in the Introduction (around page 3) briefly
explaining the placebo approach with a simple example. Something like: "To illustrate our approach, consider a firm with the same CEO from 2000-2010. We randomly assign a fake transition in 2005, creating two pseudo-CEOs. If estimated 'effects' for these pseudo-CEOs diverge substantially, this reveals the noise problem inherent in fixed effects estimation."

### 2. The Noise Problem Needs Quantification Earlier

The introduction mentions that three-quarters of effects are spurious but doesn't explain why this happens mechanically until Section 2.4.

Suggestion: Add a paragraph in Section 2.4 with the mathematical intuition: "When CEO $m$ manages firm $i$ for $T_{im}$ years, the estimated effect is $\hat{z}m = z_m + \frac{1}{T_{im}}\sum_t \epsilon_{it}$. With median tenure of 5 years and i.i.d. shocks, the noise-to-signal ratio is proportional to $1/\sqrt{T_{im}}$, making noise dominate for typical tenures."

### 3. Missing Literature Connection: Limited Mobility Bias

The paper doesn't sufficiently connect to the Andrews et al. (2008) limited mobility bias literature and Bonhomme et al. (2023) bias corrections.

Suggestion: Add a subsection 1.1 "Related Literature on Bias in Fixed Effects" that explicitly positions the placebo method as an alternative to existing bias-correction approaches when those methods fail due to extremely short panels.

### 4. The Division of Control Framework Needs Better Motivation

Section 2.1 introduces owner vs. manager control without explaining why this matters for identification.

Suggestion: Start Section 2 with: "Our model highlights a key institutional feature of private firms: the separation of strategic decisions (owner-controlled) from operational decisions (manager-controlled). This division allows us to validate our causal estimates by testing whether CEOs affect only variables under their control."

Also add a reference to Gandhi et al. (2020) who make a similar point: freely adjustable inputs are "bad controls", because they are determined by TFP, in our case manager skills.

### 5. Results Section Organization

The results jump between tables, figures, and different outcomes without a clear narrative flow.

Suggestion: Reorganize Section 5 as:

• 5.1 Production Function Estimates (establish basic parameters)
• 5.2 Raw Manager Effects and Their Distribution (show the problem)
• 5.3 The Placebo Test (reveal the noise)
• 5.4 True CEO Effects (main result)
• 5.5 Validation: Differential Effects on Manager vs Owner Variables (confirm causality)

### 6. Missing: Why Hungary?

The paper doesn't adequately explain why Hungarian data is ideal beyond completeness.

Suggestion: Add to Section 3: "Hungary provides three unique advantages: (1) mandatory registration of all directors, including CEOs, (2) no selection into coverage; all incorporated firms must report, and (3) a transition economy where CEO quality variation is likely larger than in mature markets, providing maximal statistical power."

### 7. Weak Connection Between Theory and Empirics

The model predicts $1/\chi$ amplification but this isn't well-connected to the empirical estimates.

Suggestion: Discuss the revenue, wagebill and material cost outcomes in light of the TFP increase (5.5 percent) and the estimated $\chi$ which causes magnification. Briefly mention again that we don't want to control for something that is caused by the CEO (Gandhi et al. 2020).

### 8. Missing Robustness Section

The paper mentions robustness checks but doesn't systematically present them.

Suggestion: Add an Appendix "Robustness" covering:

- Different outcome variables (log revenue, log wage bill, log materials)
- Sectoral differences in revenue function parameters
- Raw and placebo-controlled estimates in different subsamples: 
    1. after 2004
    2. including all firms with 2+ employees
    3. excluding founders and owners from event study
    4. only using giant components
    5. including all components incl very small ones

### 9. The Conclusion Undersells the Methodological Contribution

The conclusion emphasizes the substantive finding but should equally highlight the method.

Suggestion: Add a paragraph: "Our placebo-controlled approach offers a general solution for short-panel settings where traditional methods fail. This extends beyond CEOs to teachers, doctors, judges, or any setting where individual effects are estimated from limited observations. The method requires only the ability to construct credible placebo treatments."

### 10. Missing: Big-Picture Implications

The paper doesn't discuss the broader implications of the work. 

Suggestion: Add a final paragraph in the conclusion.

## Additional Edits from Krisztina's Patches

### 11. Change from Revenue to Surplus Notation Throughout

From krisztina1.patch: The theoretical framework should consistently use surplus ($s_{imst}$) rather than revenue ($r_{imst}$) notation, as surplus better captures the value creation we're measuring.

> Surplus is sometimes negative so, empirically, we always use revenue. I would stick to this notation. In the model, there is a constant share so I feel not much is lost and the flow is clearer. We may somewhere add that we ultimately care about the "value", which is driven by TFP. We already have language like

```latex
The surplus accruing to fixed factors—what owners and managers ultimately care about—equals revenue minus payments to variable inputs:
...

Manager value equals the skill difference scaled by $1/\chi$. This scaling reflects the leverage effect: a 1\% increase in manager skill generates a $(1/\chi)\%$ increase in revenue and, hence, surplus.
```
### 12. Make TFP Decomposition Explicit in Production Function

From krisztina1.patch: The production function should explicitly show how traditional TFP is decomposed into components.

> Great suggestion. I change the notation, $\Omega$ is TFP, residual TFP is the more noise-looking $\varepsilon$. 

```latex
Standard production function estimation combines the first three components into a single measure: $\Omega_{it} = A_i Z_m \varepsilon_{it}$, called total factor productivity (TFP). Our framework decomposes TFP into firm-specific advantages ($A_i$), manager-specific skill ($Z_m$), and residual productivity shocks ($\varepsilon_{it}$) to identify the manager's contribution.
```

### 13. Add Residualized Surplus Equation

From krisztina1.patch: The empirical strategy needs clearer exposition of the residualized surplus concept.

> My preferred interpretation is TFP. With the new notation, this is clearer. Once we multiply log revenue by $\chi$ and subtract contribution of fixed inputs, an estimate of $\omega$ remains.

```latex
After estimating the revenue function, we compute log total factor productivity by removing the contribution of capital from revenue:
\begin{equation}
\omega_{imst} = \hat{\chi} r_{imst} - \hat{\alpha} k_{it} - \hat{\mu}_{st} = z_m + a_i + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

This measure of log TFP contains manager skill, firm effects, and residual productivity. In standard production function estimation, this entire term would be treated as a single TFP measure. Our decomposition separates the manager contribution from other sources of productivity.
```
### 14. Clarify Identification Assumption Mathematically

From krisztina1.patch: The identifying assumption should be stated more precisely using conditional expectation notation.

> Good idea but not quite sure how to do it with the fixed effects. $\lambda$ and $z$ are not variables, they are parameters.

### 15. Improve Event Study Pre-trend Description

From krisztina2.patch: The event study results section needs clearer description of pre-transition patterns and their interpretation.

> Our new Figure 1 shows this better: https://github.com/korenmiklos/ceo-value/blob/main/output/figure/event_study.pdf. All of the pretrends come from noise. But yes, we should explain this better.

## Suggested Edits to Address Identification Concerns

### 1. Section 4 (Estimation), around lines 204-207 - Clarify the identification assumption

Current text (lines 204-207):

> The key assumptions behind this estimating equation are: (1) all firms within a sector face the same prices, and (2) residual productivity $\tilde{\epsilon}_{it}$ is uncorrelated with owner and manager choices conditional on the fixed effects.

Suggested revision:

> The key assumptions behind this estimating equation are: (1) all firms within a sector face the same prices, and (2) for each manager, residual productivity $\tilde{\epsilon}_{it}$ has zero mean when averaged across all their firms and time periods: $E[\bar{\epsilon}m] = 0$ where $\bar{\epsilon}m = \frac{1}{N_m}\sum{i,t \in m} \tilde{\epsilon}{it}$ and the sum runs over all firm-year observations under manager $m$.
> 
> Crucially, we do not require random manager mobility or that residual productivity has zero mean at the point of CEO transition. Manager assignment can be endogenous: good managers may systematically move to firms experiencing positive shocks or be hired when firms anticipate improvements. We only require that these shocks average to zero over a manager's entire career. This is a weaker assumption than random assignment but still substantive: it rules out managers who systematically arrive at permanently improving (or declining) firms.


### 2. After line 217 - Add discussion of event study validation

Add new paragraph:

> The event study provides a diagnostic test for this identification assumption. Pre-trends in productivity before CEO transitions would suggest (though not prove) that the zero-mean assumption is violated. If productivity systematically rises before good CEOs arrive, we worry that the positive trend continues post-transition, violating $E[\bar{\epsilon}_m] = 0$. Conversely, the absence of pre-trends makes it harder to construct plausible endogeneity stories. While we cannot rule out contemporaneous shocks that coincide exactly with CEO changes (e.g., owners simultaneously firing the CEO and adopting new technology), such precise timing is less plausible than gradual changes that would manifest as pre-trends. Our event studies show no significant pre-trends, supporting but not proving our identification assumption.
