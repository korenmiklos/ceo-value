# How the Placebo Event Study Works

## Overview

The placebo-controlled event study design is a novel methodological contribution that separates true CEO effects from spurious correlations. The key insight is not that treated firms are systematically different, but rather that standard event studies conflate true managerial impact with small-sample noise from TFP measurement. By creating "fake" CEO transitions in control firms, we can isolate mechanical bias arising from limited mobility and noisy productivity estimates.

## The Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify Actual CEO Transitions (`event_study_sample.do`)

The script first identifies firms with clean CEO transitions:
- Selects single-CEO firms (max 1 CEO per year)
- Focuses on founder-to-non-founder transitions only
- Requires firms to have CEOs for at least 2 consecutive spells
- Defines an 8-year event window (-4 to +3 years around transition)
- Requires at least 1 observation before and after the transition (minimal constraint)

From 3.5 million firm-year observations, this yields 18,327 treated firms with clean CEO changes.

### Step 2: Generate Placebo Transitions (`placebo.do`)

The script creates a target of 100 control firms per treatment group, where each group is defined by birth cohort and event window:

1. **Match on cohort and window**: Control firms must have the same founding year (cohort) and have a "clean" event windowâ€”meaning no actual CEO change occurs during that window (or a larger encompassing window)
2. **Random timing**: Assigns placebo CEO changes with the same timing distribution (`t0`) as actual changes within each treatment group
3. **Sampling weights**: Adjusts weights to ensure balanced representation across cohorts, event windows, and timing patterns

The actual dataset contains millions of potential control firms (many firms can serve as controls for multiple treatment groups), so we could use many more than 100 per group, but this target size is sufficient for statistical efficiency. The result is 183,733 control firm-spells with placebo transitions that mirror the temporal and cohort patterns of actual CEO changes but occur in firms without real management turnover during their event windows.

### Step 3: Estimate Treatment Effects (`setup_event_study.do` and `event_study.do`)

The estimation proceeds in several stages:

1. **Sample selection**: To estimate quickly, the script takes random 10% samples from the full dataset (approximately 1 million observations), though the full model will also be run for final results
2. **Create fake CEO spells**: For placebo firms, artificially splits the observation period into two CEO spells at the placebo transition date
3. **Compute CEO quality**: 
   - For actual transitions: Uses true estimated manager fixed effects
   - For placebo transitions: Calculates average TFP in each fake spell to create placebo "manager skill" measures
4. **Classify CEO quality**: Labels transitions as "good" (measured manager skill increases) or "bad" (skill decreases) based on these measures
5. **Control structure**: Note that firm age controls have been removed from all regressions because we match on firm cohort
6. **Run event studies**: Estimates treatment effects comparing actual vs placebo CEO changes to isolate true causal effects
