# How the Placebo Event Study Works

## Overview

The placebo-controlled event study design is a novel methodological contribution that separates true CEO effects from spurious correlations. The key insight is that standard event studies overstate CEO impact because firms experiencing CEO changes are systematically different from those that don't. By creating "fake" CEO transitions in similar firms, we can isolate the causal effect of CEO quality.

## The Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify Actual CEO Transitions (`event_study_sample.do`)

The script first identifies firms with clean CEO transitions:
- Selects single-CEO firms (max 1 CEO per year)
- Focuses on founder-to-non-founder transitions only
- Requires firms to have CEOs for at least 2 consecutive spells
- Defines an 8-year event window (-4 to +3 years around transition)
- Ensures sufficient observations before and after the transition

From 3.5 million firm-year observations, this yields 18,327 treated firms with clean CEO changes.

### Step 2: Generate Placebo Transitions (`placebo.do`)

For each treated firm, the script creates approximately 100 control firms with fake CEO changes:

1. **Match on observables**: Control firms must have the same founding year (cohort) and similar observation windows
2. **Random timing**: Assigns placebo CEO changes with the same timing distribution as actual changes
3. **Sampling weights**: Adjusts weights to ensure balanced representation across cohorts and time periods

The result is 183,733 control firm-spells with placebo transitions that mirror the temporal pattern of actual CEO changes but occur in firms without real management turnover.

### Step 3: Estimate Treatment Effects (`setup_event_study.do` and `event_study.do`)

The estimation proceeds in several stages:

1. **Create fake CEO spells**: For placebo firms, artificially splits the observation period into two CEO spells at the placebo transition date
2. **Compute fake CEO quality**: Calculates average TFP in each fake spell to create placebo "manager skill" measures
3. **Classify CEO quality**: Labels transitions as "good" (improvement) or "bad" (deterioration) based on skill differences
4. **Run event studies**: Estimates several treatment effects:
   - Actual vs placebo CEO changes (true causal effect)
   - Better vs worse CEOs within actual changes
   - Better vs worse CEOs within placebo changes (mechanical bias)
   - Variance effects to capture heterogeneity

## Key Findings

### The Decomposition

The raw correlation between CEO changes and firm performance is 22.5% (comparing better to worse CEOs). However:
- **Placebo effect**: 17.4% improvement occurs even with fake CEO changes
- **True causal effect**: Only 5.5% is attributable to actual CEO quality (25% of raw correlation)
- **Variance increases**: Post-transition variance rises, indicating heterogeneous firm responses

### Interpretation

The 17.4% placebo effect reveals that most apparent CEO impact is spuriousâ€”arising from:
- **Regression to the mean**: Firms change CEOs after bad performance, naturally bounce back
- **Selection bias**: Firms choosing new CEOs are systematically different
- **Timing effects**: CEO changes coincide with other organizational changes

The true 5.5% causal effect aligns with quasi-experimental evidence from sudden CEO deaths and family successions, validating the methodology.

## Technical Innovation

This approach solves the "limited mobility bias" problem in two-way fixed effects models. By comparing actual and placebo transitions with identical selection patterns, we separate:
- Mechanical bias from limited switchers (captured by placebo)
- True managerial effects (difference between actual and placebo)
- Heterogeneous responses (through variance decomposition)

The method generalizes beyond CEOs to any setting where treatment assignment is endogenous but follows observable patterns.
