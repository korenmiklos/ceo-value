60 \textbf{First}, we develop a placebo-controlled event study methodology that separates true CEO effects from spurious correlations. By constructing placebo CEO transitions---randomly assigned fake changes that exclude actual transition periods---we isolate mechanical biases from genuine impacts. The naive comparison shows firms hiring better CEOs outperform those hiring worse CEOs by 25.3 percent. Remarkably, placebo transitions generate a 19.7 percent effect despite no actual management change. The true causal impact is thus 5.5 percent: the difference between actual and placebo effects.
61 
62 \textbf{Second}, we ground this empirical strategy in a model-based framework that clarifies what we can and cannot measure. Building on \citet{Lucas1978-rp} and decreasing returns models of \citet{AtkesonKehoe2005JPE, McGrattan2012RED}, we explicitly separate owner-controlled inputs (capital,initial organizational structure) from manager-controlled inputs (labor, materials). This distinction is crucial: CEOs receive credit for many factors outside their control. Our framework identifies the marginal contribution of CEO skills to firm surplus while holding fixed the inputs chosen by owners.
63 
64 \textbf{Third}, we implement this approach using extraordinary data: the universe of Hungarian firms over three decades (1992-2022). We track 1,063,172 firms and 1,030,470 unique CEOs, identifying a connected network of 189,108 managers who lead multiple firms. This scale dwarfs previous studies---\citet{fee2013managers} examine 500 firms, \citet{fenizia2022managers} study 433 public administrations, even \citet{metcalfe2023managers} cover 66,000 stores. Our data enables precise estimation of manager effects through 51,736 firms with exactly one CEO change, providing statistical power to separate signal from noise that smaller samples cannot achieve.

74 The production function for firm $i$ with manager $m$ at time $t$ is:
75 \begin{equation}\label{eq:production}
76 Q_{imt} = \underbrace{\Omega_{it}A_i Z_{m}}_{TFP_{it}}  K_{it}^\alpha L_{imt}^{\beta} M_{imt}^{\gamma}
77 \end{equation}
78 where $\Omega_{it}$ is residual total factor productivity, $A_i$ represents time-invariant organizational capital and immaterial assets (location, brand value), $Z_m$ captures manager skill, $K_{it}$ is physical capital, $L_{imt}$ is labor input, $M_{imt}$ is intermediate input usage. The parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ represent the elasticities with respect to physical capital, labor and material inputs, respectively. We denote $\chi := 1 - \beta - \gamma$. Conditional on productivity, initial organizational capital and manager skill, the production function exhibits decreasing returns to scale, $\alpha + \beta + \gamma < 1$. In a traditional production function with only capital, labor and material as inputs, $\Omega$, $A$ and $Z$ would all be lumped together as \emph{total factor productivity}.
79 
80 We assume managers optimize variable inputs $L_{imt}$ and $M_{imt}$ while taking fixed inputs $A_{i}$ and $Z_m$ and physical capital $K_{it}$ as given. In private businesses, owners typically have direct control over fixed inputs, including large-scale investments in organizational and physical capital \citep{Navaretti2010EFIGE}. Managers, on the other hand, are responsible for day-to-day operations and variable input choices.

203 207 \paragraph{Event study.}
204 208 Finally, to check the dynamic effects around CEO changes, we conduct an event study analysis. This involves estimating the impact of CEO transitions on firm performance over time, allowing us to observe any pre-trends and post-trends associated with the change in leadership. 
205 209 
206 210 We compare the evolution of TFP between three groups of firms which all experience a CEO change: the first group experiences a decline in  measured CEO skill due to the change in managers, the second one experiences roughly no change in CEO quality due to the transition, while the third group experiences an improvement in measured CEO quality. Because we do not use any CEO observables, we compare firms hiring better CEOs against those hiring worse CEOs, as defined by their estimated fixed effects. This approach, however, suffers from potential bias because the estimated fixed effects include an average of residual TFP. Even if residual TFP is uncorrelated with CEO replacement, as we assumed, differentiating ``better'' and ``worse'' CEOs based on this noisy measure will overestimate the effect of CEO skill.
207 211 
208 212 To mitigate this bias, we create a control group of firms in the same industry that did not change their CEOs during the treatment period. For these control firms, we create ``placebo'' CEO changes by randomly splitting their lifetime into CEO spells. The placebo treatment captures the bias, because it only measures the average residual TFP before and after the random splits, when CEO skill has not actually changed.  The placebo spells are constructed ensuring that the distribution of CEO tenures remains consistent with the original data.

330 334 This paper develops and implements a comprehensive framework for measuring CEO value in privately held businesses using administrative data. Our approach addresses a fundamental challenge in development economics: how to assess the importance of managerial talent when traditional measures based on stock market valuations or executive compensation are unavailable.
331 335 
332 336 Our theoretical framework, building on the decreasing returns to scale models of \citet{AtkesonKehoe2005JPE} and \citet{McGrattan2012RED}, shows how manager skills can be identified through their impact on firm surplus while controlling for initial organizational capital and sectoral conditions. The empirical implementation combines three complementary identification strategies---within-firm variation, manager mobility networks, and quasi-experimental event studies---to provide robust evidence on CEO value.

334 338 Applied to comprehensive Hungarian administrative data covering 1992-2022, our analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in CEO skills with large economic consequences. Within firms, replacing a 25th percentile manager with a 75th percentile manager increases productivity by 9.6 percent. Across the connected component of mobile managers, the same replacement increases productivity by 24.6 percent, suggesting considerable skill heterogeneity in the broader managerial labor market.

340 344 Our methodology offers practical advantages for future research. The framework uses standard administrative records available in most countries, making it broadly applicable without the resource-intensive data collection required for diary studies or management surveys. This accessibility enables researchers to replicate our approach across different institutional settings and time periods.
341 345 
342 346 Our model-based approach provides theoretical clarity by By explicitly separating owner-controlled inputs (capital, initial organizational structure) from manager-controlled inputs (labor, materials), we identify what portion of firm performance can genuinely be attributed to CEO skill. This theoretical foundation explains why raw correlations overstate CEO importance: managers often receive credit for advantages stemming from initial organizational capital or favorable market conditions that are outside their control. The finding that 73 percent of apparent effects are spurious validates the importance of this theoretical separation and suggests policies targeting managerial quality will have more modest impacts than the raw correlations imply.
343 347 
344 348 Several limitations suggest directions for future research. Our measure of CEO skill captures the portion of managerial ability that translates into firm surplus, but may not fully capture other aspects of leadership such as strategic vision or organizational development that matter over longer horizons. Additionally, while our event study design provides causal evidence around CEO transitions, the endogenous nature of most CEO appointments means our estimates may not fully capture the equilibrium effects of randomly improving manager-firm matching.
