# Recommended Paper Outline

## 1. Introduction

* **Para 1**: Motivate the question: What is the value of CEOs? Stress that while management matters, most evidence comes from public firms in rich countries.
* **Para 2**: Argue why private firms are different (owner influence, noisier data, lack of transparency).
* **Para 3**: Preview your contribution: model that accounts for owner choices, unique Hungarian dataset, placebo method.
* **Para 4**: State headline result: naïve estimates overstate CEO effects (22%), placebo method shows true causal effect ≈ 5%.
* **Para 5**: Place your work relative to public-firm CEO studies (Bertrand–Schoar, Bennedsen, Metcalfe, etc.).
* **Para 6**: Discuss literature on management practices (Bloom, Giorcelli, etc.), emphasize gap in private firms.
* **Para 7**: Highlight methodological parallels to labor econ fixed effects and econometric challenges.

## 2. A Model of Owner- and CEO-Driven Production

* **Para 1**: Introduce production structure: owners set fixed inputs, CEOs choose variable inputs.
* **Para 2**: Explain Cobb–Douglas specification, define role of CEO skill $Z_m$.
* **Para 3**: Show how optimization leads to surplus share χ, and why 1/χ scaling matters.
* **Para 4**: Clarify estimable equation: revenue depends on capital, CEO skill, firm FE, sector-time FE.
* **Para 5**: Identify assumptions (sectoral prices, residual TFP exogeneity, arbitrary owner–manager correlation).

## 3. Corporate Data from Hungary

* **Para 1**: Why Hungary? (complete coverage, transition economy, EU accession).
* **Para 2**: Firm registry: CEO appointments, ownership.
* **Para 3**: Balance sheet data: revenues, costs, assets.
* **Para 4**: Data cleaning challenges: what is a firm, what is a CEO, entity resolution.
* **Para 5**: Sample restrictions: CEO turnover cutoffs, state-owned exclusions, min size.
* **Para 6**: Descriptive patterns: CEO demographics, founder prevalence, network connectedness.
* **Para 7**: Turnover patterns: spells length, placebo comparability.

## 4. Estimation

* **Para 1**: Outline four steps: surplus share, revenue function, FE estimation, event study.
* **Para 2**: Discuss identification challenges: residual TFP, connected components, small-sample noise.
* **Para 3**: Introduce placebo method: hazard-based simulated changes in stable firms.
* **Para 4**: Argue why placebo removes noise and validates causal inference.

## 5. Results

* **Para 1**: Raw dispersion of CEO fixed effects suggests \~22% differences.
* **Para 2**: Event study evidence: timing consistent with CEO impact, but noisy.
* **Para 3**: Placebo-adjusted estimates: only \~5% true causal effect.
* **Para 4**: Outcome correlations: good CEOs increase sales, wages, materials; weaker on fixed assets, foreign ownership.
* **Para 5**: Dynamics: immediate material spending vs gradual growth in intangibles.
* **Para 6**: Robustness previews: founders vs non-founders, exclusion thresholds, period splits.

## 6. Conclusion

* **Para 1**: Recap main findings: three-quarters of apparent CEO effect is spurious.
* **Para 2**: CEOs matter modestly (\~5%), mainly by scaling variable inputs.
* **Para 3**: Implications for corporate governance and productivity research. Don’t trust raw CEO FEs: mostly noise.
* **Para 4**: Instead, use observables (education, cohort, foreign name). Cite related work by De Pirron, Koren and Laki, Koren and Orban and Koren and Telegdy.
* **Para 5**: Highlight open issues (connected component representativeness, founders vs successors, transition vs EU period).
