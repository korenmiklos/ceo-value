# Meeting Notes: October 31, 2025

## Paper Revision Discussion - Pre-submission Review

---

## Introduction (Krisztina)

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Panel dimension and autocorrelation**
   - Need to clarify: Do errors need to be autocorrelated? Are they generally thought to be autocorrelated in relevant literatures?
   - Answer: Yes in firm panels, but not typically emphasized in labor literature
   - Action: Add 2 sentences explaining this distinction - labor literature doesn't care about dynamics, but firm/corporate finance literature always has panels and autocorrelation is standard

2. **Positioning relative to labor literature**
   - Major distinction: Labor people don't care about dynamics/time dimension; corporate finance always does
   - Labor literature: Started with people (Mincer regressions), added firm fixed effects later
   - Corporate finance: Started with firms, now adding CEO fixed effects
   - It's a "dual problem" - same econometrics, different focus
   - Action: Emphasize this is a firm panel paper from the outset (title, abstract, first paragraph)

3. **Pre-trend bias as novel contribution**
   - **Key result**: Pre-trends are also biased (not just variance/covariance)
   - This appears to be NEW - not identified in labor literature before
   - Labor literature rarely does pre-trend tests (Card/Kline paper has 2-4 years max, mainly to show random mobility)
   - Action: Emphasize this as signature contribution - we show bias in variance, covariance, AND pre-trends

4. **Connected component/network structure**
   - Important distinction: We don't need to worry about connected components because we difference out firm fixed effects
   - This is standard in corporate finance event studies (e.g., CEO deaths)
   - Action: Add one sentence in intro clarifying we don't need network structure for this paper

5. **Title and framing**
   - Current title may not capture the event study/panel dimension clearly enough
   - Suggestion: Something like "CEO Replacement and Firm Growth" or similar
   - Action: Consider revising title to emphasize CEO changes/transitions in firm panels

6. **Relationship to Bonhomme et al. methods**
   - Currently calling them "parametric" which is somewhat unfair
   - Better description: "clustering methods" or "dimension reduction"
   - In our context, would mean grouping CEOs (not firms) - we have 900k-1.3M CEOs, grouping into 5-12 clusters seems impractical
   - Alternative observable-based grouping: leader vs manager CEOs (Sadun et al.)
   - Action: Revise description to be fairer; mention as third method alongside parametric and leave-one-out; add half-sentence on why clustering not typical in CEO studies

7. **Labor literature discussion length**
   - Currently too much focus on leave-one-out and labor methods (longer paragraph than our own method)
   - Risk: Too much labor literature discussion will attract labor referees
   - Action: Condense further, move detailed comparison to footnote; main text should emphasize corporate finance audience

8. **First paragraph positioning**
   - Should immediately establish: This is about CEO changes in firm panels, event studies, what happens when CEOs change
   - Frame as "How much do CEOs matter?" interpreted as panel event study question
   - Action: Rewrite opening to set stage correctly from sentence 1-2

### Completed Edits
- Shortened leave-one-out discussion significantly
- Added explanation of why existing methods fail in CEO context
- Added "difference-in-differences for second moments" framing
- Added discussion of spurious pre-trends as practical problem for researchers

## Monte Carlo (Miklós)

### Issues to Address

1. **Missing description of setup**
   - Problem: Text doesn't explain what the Monte Carlo actually does
   - Need: One paragraph explaining we take equation 1, plug in parameters, draw normal shocks with reported variances, run the estimator
   - Action: Add clear description of Monte Carlo data generating process

2. **Parameter justification**
   - Need to state: Parameter values chosen with eye towards application
   - Coefficients similar to what we see in real data
   - Action: Add sentence in Monte Carlo intro; possibly report autocorrelation in application for comparison

3. **Why three scenarios?**
   - Baseline: balanced panels, i.i.d. shocks
   - Persistent shocks: Need citation showing firm panels have autocorrelated shocks (probably Olley-Pakes or similar)
   - Excess variance: Need to justify that treated and control can differ (report one number from application: excess variance factor ~1.7)
   - Action: Add brief justification for each scenario with citations

4. **Different graph presentations (Monte Carlo vs Application)**
   - Monte Carlo: Shows control vs treated (to explain mechanics of bias)
   - Application: Shows debiased vs naive (to show method works)
   - This is intentional but not explained
   - Action: Add 2-3 sentences explaining why we present differently in each section

5. **Consistency of assumptions question**
   - Question raised: Are strict exogeneity (uncorrelated with Z) and autocorrelated shocks consistent?
   - Answer: Yes - these are two separate statements about different objects
   - Epsilon can be highly autocorrelated while still uncorrelated with Z path
   - Caveat: In structural model where CEOs are chosen endogenously, this might be problematic (similar to Olley-Pakes investment bias)
   - Resolution: This is an econometrics paper; these are our assumptions; don't open structural can of worms

6. **Potential additional robustness check**
   - Referee might ask: What if autocorrelation structure differs between treated and control? (ρ=0.9 vs ρ=0.8)
   - This would be misspecification test
   - Could be done in ~60 minutes of coding
   - Decision: Don't do now; wait to see if referee asks; classify as reasonable R&R request

7. **Six scenarios structure**
   - Should emphasize three major groups:
     1. Uncorrelated shocks
     2. Correlated shocks  
     3. Excess variance
   - Action: Make this grouping clearer in text

### Key Points to Emphasize
- Our method is quite non-parametric: we don't need to model Σ (can be AR12, non-Markovian, whatever)
- We only assume Σ is same across groups up to scalar
- This is much weaker than parametric methods

## Application (Álmos)

### Issues to Address

1. **Graph presentation explanation**
   - Need 2-3 sentences explaining why we show naive vs debiased (not control vs treated like in Monte Carlo)
   - Rationale: Already explained mechanics; now showing method performance
   - Action: Add brief explanation at start of Results section

2. **Descriptive statistics**
   - Keep minimal: number of firms, mostly small, many founder-managed, average spell length 3 years
   - Don't waste space on extra descriptive tables
   - This is methods paper; full application in companion paper
   - Action: Brief descriptives in text only

3. **What to report**
   - Must report: Excess variance factor (one number, ~1.7)
   - Must show: Event study figures look beautiful
   - Quantitative claim: R-squared bias (quote in abstract) - naive 40-58%, corrected 20-35%
   - Action: Ensure these key numbers are prominent

4. **Autocorrelation in data**
   - Question: Should we report autocorrelation coefficient from application?
   - Decision: Probably NOT - would make it more structural than needed
   - Σ can be anything; don't need to assume AR(1) in application
   - Action: Don't report unless necessary for other reasons

5. **Level of structural detail**
   - Don't go deep into DGP in real data
   - We don't know true data generating process
   - Method works under stated assumptions; application shows it produces nice results
   - That's sufficient
   - Action: Keep application focused on showing method works, not on structural interpretation

6. **Text editing needed**
   - Last section text "not ready" according to notes
   - Action: Review and edit application section prose

### Key Message
- Develop method carefully in Monte Carlo
- Show it works beautifully in application  
- Don't overclaim about what we know regarding true DGP

## Backlog (For other paper or future if referees ask)

### Methodological Extensions

1. **Structural estimation with manager fixed effects**
   - Open question: How to do Olley-Pakes/GMM properly with manager fixed effects?
   - If getting a manager is like an investment, should be in first stage
   - This could be important standalone contribution
   - Huge literature on productivity estimation, but adding manager FE properly not yet solved
   - Decision: Punt to application paper; don't make that paper also become methods paper

2. **Endogeneity of CEO choice**
   - With autocorrelated shocks, firm might hire/fire CEO based on shock realization
   - Similar to Olley-Pakes investment bias
   - In structural model, strict exogeneity and autocorrelation might create tension
   - Decision: Not addressing in this econometrics paper; maintain assumptions as stated

3. **Misspecification tests**
   - What if autocorrelation structure differs (not just variance level)?
   - What if ρ varies across groups?
   - Could add robustness checks if referee requests
   - Decision: Wait for R&R; reasonable request but don't preempt

4. **Alternative variance structures**
   - Beyond scalar differences
   - Fully different Σ matrices
   - Decision: Out of scope; our assumption is proportional autocovariance

5. **Mismatch effects and short spells**
   - Literature on CEO-firm mismatch (short spells = mismatch)
   - Could interact with our methods
   - Decision: Interesting but for different paper

6. **Leader vs Manager CEO types**
   - Observable-based grouping (Sadun et al.)
   - Could be complement to our fixed effects approach
   - Decision: Mention briefly in lit review; not main focus

### Data and Sample Issues

7. **Founder-managed descriptives**
   - Whether founder-managed or not
   - Decision: Don't waste space; not central to methods contribution

8. **Industry heterogeneity**
   - Might want to check robustness across industries
   - Decision: For application paper if at all

### Things Explicitly NOT to Do Now

- Don't add more descriptive tables
- Don't report autocorrelation structure from data
- Don't go structural with DGP discussion
- Don't add robustness to different ρ (unless referee asks)
- Don't discuss connected component issues in detail (not relevant given our differencing approach)
- Don't spend more space on labor literature (already shortened)
- Don't make application paper also a methods paper
