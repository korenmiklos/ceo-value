## CEO and Manager Effects: Key Applied Micro Studies

Each entry briefly states the **method**, **setting (country & sample)**, and **main findings** in 3‑4 sentences, followed by a concise note on how our study differs.

---

### Bertrand & Schoar (2003, *QJE*)
*Method:* Manager fixed‑effects panel regressions (reduced‑form). *Setting:* 6,000 U.S. publicly listed firms, 1969‑1991. *Findings:* CEO identity explains sizable variation in corporate policies—switching from a 25th‑ to 75th‑percentile “style” alters ROA by ~4 pp and leverage by ~9 pp, indicating persistent manager influence. *Our difference:* structural estimation with universal private‑firm coverage rather than reduced‑form evidence from public companies.

### Fisman, Khurana, Rhodes‑Kropf & Yim (2014, *Management Science*)
*Method:* Difference‑in‑differences exploiting staggered adoption of shareholder‑friendly governance laws. *Setting:* U.S. S&P 1500 firms, 1990‑2007. *Findings:* Greater shareholder power accelerates CEO turnover but can induce myopic firings after temporary performance dips, highlighting governance–performance trade‑offs. *Our difference:* owner‑controlled private firms let us focus on CEO productivity effects without board–CEO conflicts.

### Bandiera, Prat, Hansen & Sadun (2020, *JPE*)
*Method:* Machine‑learning classification of high‑frequency CEO diary data plus reduced‑form regressions. *Setting:* 1,114 medium‑to‑large firms across six countries (Brazil, France, Germany, India, U.K., U.S.). *Findings:* “Leader”‑type CEOs—who allocate more time to multi‑functional, high‑level meetings—raise firm productivity by ~8 % and need roughly three years to realize gains; matching between CEO type and firm matters. *Our difference:* administrative data on **all** firms allow us to estimate a continuous distribution of CEO skill via a structural production model rather than survey‑based behavior measures.

### Bennedsen, Pérez‑González & Wolfenzon (2020, *Journal of Finance*)
*Method:* Event‑study and diff‑in‑diff around unexpected CEO hospitalizations. *Setting:* ~13,000 Danish private SMEs, 1996‑2012. *Findings:* A one‑week CEO absence lowers ROA by 7 % and sales by 3 %; longer absences have larger effects, proving CEOs are hard to replace quickly. *Our difference:* we infer steady‑state CEO productivity from routine mobility and model owner mitigation, rather than rare health shocks.

### Metcalfe, Sollaci & Syverson (2023, BFI WP 2023‑64)
*Method:* Two‑way fixed effects and variance decomposition leveraging 6,500 store‑manager moves within two U.S. big‑box retailers. *Setting:* 2011‑2018 store‑level operational data. *Findings:* Managers explain 20–30 % of store‑level sales variance; negative assortative matching biases simple mover designs. *Our difference:* nationwide multi‑industry panel and structural model correct for owner and firm heterogeneity, addressing selection concerns raised by the authors.

### Dahlstrand, László, Schweiger, Bandiera, Prat & Sadun (2025, NBER WP 33324)
*Method:* Cross‑country CEO diary data with random‑forest productivity prediction. *Setting:* 4,800 manufacturing firms in 42 countries, 2014‑2019. *Findings:* "Leader" CEOs boost TFP by ~12 %; poorer countries have fewer leaders, implying management constraints to development. *Our difference:* we estimate CEO value for **all** firms in a single economy over 30 years using administrative financials, capturing owner–CEO complementarities absent in diary studies.

### Koren & Telegdy (2024, CESifo WP 11164)
*Method:* Event‑study diff‑in‑diff around foreign acquisitions introducing expatriate CEOs. *Setting:* Hungarian manufacturing firms, 1992‑2019. *Findings:* Replacing locals with expatriate managers raises TFP by 13 % and sales by 95 %, suggesting large gains from importing managerial talent. *Our difference:* broader CEO skill distribution (not only expatriates) and structural identification disentangle talent from ownership effects.

### Janke, Propper & Sadun (2024 rev., NBER WP 25853)
*Method:* Difference‑in‑differences exploiting CEO turnovers in English NHS hospitals. *Setting:* 260 public hospitals, 2005‑2018. *Findings:* CEO changes have minimal impact on mortality or financial performance, pointing to limited discretion in the public sector. *Our difference:* profit‑driven private context reveals much larger CEO productivity effects.

### Muñoz & Otero (2024, *Journal of Public Economics*)
*Method:* Instrumental‑variables diff‑in‑diff using rotation of civil‑service CEOs. *Setting:* Chilean public hospitals, 2002‑2017. *Findings:* High‑ability CEOs reduce hospital mortality by 6 % and increase patient satisfaction, indicating management matters even in bureaucratic settings. *Our difference:* we quantify productivity (not mortality) and account for capital, labor, and owner inputs in private firms.

### Foundations in Worker & Firm Fixed‑Effects

**Abowd, Kramarz & Margolis (1999, *Econometrica*)** – Two‑way worker‑firm fixed‑effects model using French matched employer–employee data shows both worker and firm components drive wage dispersion. *Our difference:* adapt the AKM logic to CEOs and surplus with structural interpretation.

**Card, Cardoso, Heining & Kline (2018, *JLE*)** – Extend AKM to Portugal & Germany; firm wage effects explain ~20 % of wage variance and limited assortative sorting. *Our difference:* decompose productivity (not wages) and structurally evaluate CEO re‑matching gains.

---

### Structural Contract Work

**Miller & Xie (2025, manuscript)** – Structural estimation of executive principal‑agent contracts for U.S. public firms; agency costs exceed 5 % of firm value. *Our difference:* focus on production‑side CEO productivity rather than contract design.

The model shows that firm effects explain about 20 % of wage variance and that high‑wage workers systematically sort into high‑wage firms. Sorting amplifies inequality because the covariance between worker and firm components is positive.
