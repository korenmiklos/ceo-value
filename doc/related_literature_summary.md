## CEO and Manager Effects: Key Applied Micro Studies

Each entry briefly states the **method**, **setting (country & sample)**, and **main findings** in 3‑4 sentences, followed by a concise note on how our study differs.

---

### Bertrand & Schoar (2003, *QJE*)
*Method:* Manager fixed‑effects panel regressions (reduced‑form). *Setting:* 6,000 U.S. publicly listed firms, 1969‑1991. *Findings:* CEO identity explains sizable variation in corporate policies—switching from a 25th‑ to 75th‑percentile “style” alters ROA by ~4 pp and leverage by ~9 pp, indicating persistent manager influence. *Our difference:* structural estimation with universal private‑firm coverage rather than reduced‑form evidence from public companies.

### Fisman, Khurana, Rhodes‑Kropf & Yim (2014, *Management Science*)
*Method:* Difference‑in‑differences exploiting staggered adoption of shareholder‑friendly governance laws. *Setting:* U.S. S&P 1500 firms, 1990‑2007. *Findings:* Greater shareholder power accelerates CEO turnover but can induce myopic firings after temporary performance dips, highlighting governance–performance trade‑offs. *Our difference:* owner‑controlled private firms let us focus on CEO productivity effects without board–CEO conflicts.

### Bandiera, Prat, Hansen & Sadun (2020, *JPE*)
*Method:* Machine‑learning classification of high‑frequency CEO diary data plus reduced‑form regressions. *Setting:* 1,114 medium‑to‑large firms across six countries (Brazil, France, Germany, India, U.K., U.S.). *Findings:* “Leader”‑type CEOs—who allocate more time to multi‑functional, high‑level meetings—raise firm productivity by ~8 % and need roughly three years to realize gains; matching between CEO type and firm matters. *Our difference:* administrative data on **all** firms allow us to estimate a continuous distribution of CEO skill via a structural production model rather than survey‑based behavior measures.

### Bennedsen, Pérez‑González & Wolfenzon (2020, *Journal of Finance*)
*Method:* Event‑study and diff‑in‑diff around unexpected CEO hospitalizations. *Setting:* ~13,000 Danish private SMEs, 1996‑2012. *Findings:* A one‑week CEO absence lowers ROA by 7 % and sales by 3 %; longer absences have larger effects, proving CEOs are hard to replace quickly. *Our difference:* we infer steady‑state CEO productivity from routine mobility and model owner mitigation, rather than rare health shocks.

### Metcalfe, Sollaci & Syverson (2023, BFI WP 2023‑64)
*Method:* Two‑way fixed effects and variance decomposition leveraging 6,500 store‑manager moves within two U.S. big‑box retailers. *Setting:* 2011‑2018 store‑level operational data. *Findings:* Managers explain 20–30 % of store‑level sales variance; negative assortative matching biases simple mover designs. *Our difference:* nationwide multi‑industry panel and structural model correct for owner and firm heterogeneity, addressing selection concerns raised by the authors.

### Dahlstrand, László, Schweiger, Bandiera, Prat & Sadun (2025, NBER WP 33324)
*Method:* Cross‑country CEO diary data with random‑forest productivity prediction. *Setting:* 4,800 manufacturing firms in 42 countries, 2014‑2019. *Findings:* "Leader" CEOs boost TFP by ~12 %; poorer countries have fewer leaders, implying management constraints to development. *Our difference:* we estimate CEO value for **all** firms in a single economy over 30 years using administrative financials, capturing owner–CEO complementarities absent in diary studies.

### Koren & Telegdy (2024, CESifo WP 11164)
*Method:* Event‑study diff‑in‑diff around foreign acquisitions introducing expatriate CEOs. *Setting:* Hungarian manufacturing firms, 1992‑2019. *Findings:* Replacing locals with expatriate managers raises TFP by 13 % and sales by 95 %, suggesting large gains from importing managerial talent. *Our difference:* broader CEO skill distribution (not only expatriates) and structural identification disentangle talent from ownership effects.

### Janke, Propper & Sadun (2024 rev., NBER WP 25853)
*Method:* Difference‑in‑differences exploiting CEO turnovers in English NHS hospitals. *Setting:* 260 public hospitals, 2005‑2018. *Findings:* CEO changes have minimal impact on mortality or financial performance, pointing to limited discretion in the public sector. *Our difference:* profit‑driven private context reveals much larger CEO productivity effects.

### Muñoz & Otero (2024, *Journal of Public Economics*)
*Method:* Instrumental‑variables diff‑in‑diff using rotation of civil‑service CEOs. *Setting:* Chilean public hospitals, 2002‑2017. *Findings:* High‑ability CEOs reduce hospital mortality by 6 % and increase patient satisfaction, indicating management matters even in bureaucratic settings. *Our difference:* we quantify productivity (not mortality) and account for capital, labor, and owner inputs in private firms.

### Foundations in Worker & Firm Fixed‑Effects

**Abowd, Kramarz & Margolis (1999, *Econometrica*)** – Two‑way worker‑firm fixed‑effects model using French matched employer–employee data shows both worker and firm components drive wage dispersion. *Our difference:* adapt the AKM logic to CEOs and surplus with structural interpretation.

**Card, Cardoso, Heining & Kline (2018, *JLE*)** – Extend AKM to Portugal & Germany; firm wage effects explain ~20 % of wage variance and limited assortative sorting. *Our difference:* decompose productivity (not wages) and structurally evaluate CEO re‑matching gains.

---

### Structural Contract Work

**Miller & Xie (2025, manuscript)** – Structural estimation of executive principal‑agent contracts for U.S. public firms; agency costs exceed 5 % of firm value. *Our difference:* focus on production‑side CEO productivity rather than contract design.

(2011). *Executive compensation in Japan: Estimating levels and determinants from tax records.* Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 20(3), 843–885. | What determines executive pay in Japan? | Japanese listed firms, using tax record data. | Japanese execs earn ~1/5 of US levels; pay linked to firm size and accounting profits, not stock returns. | Like us, uses administrative data; shows how non-US institutions shape CEO outcomes. We extend with a productivity framework. |

(2014). *Corporate control and executive selection.* Quantitative Economics, 5(2), 417–456. | How do private benefits distort executive selection? | Italian firms, matched ownership and executive data. | Family/government control distorts selection; reduces average exec ability, lowers TFP ~10%. | Very close to our theme: also models distortions in private firms. We extend by separating signal vs noise in CEO fixed effects. |

| Quigley, T. J., Chirico, F., & Baù, M. (2022). Does the CEO effect on performance differ in private versus public firms? *Strategic Organization*, 20(3), 652–673. | Are CEO effects different in private vs. public firms? | Sweden; 1,501 private and 178 public firms, 1997–2013; admin financials matched to employer–employee data. | CEO effects differ across ownership; private-firm CEOs face resource/risk constraints and lower pay than public-firm CEOs. | Validates our focus on private firms and constrained CEO discretion. Our owner–CEO decision-rights model explains why raw CEO FE can overstate impact; our placebo design corrects that bias. |
| Gao, H., & Li, K. (2015). A comparison of CEO pay–performance sensitivity in privately-held and public firms. *Journal of Corporate Finance*, 35, 370–388. | Do CEO pay levels and sensitivities differ between private and public firms? | U.S. large private firms subject to SEC disclosure vs. public firms, 1999–2011. | Private CEOs are paid less; pay–performance sensitivity weaker in private firms. | Supports our premise that in concentrated ownership, CEOs have lower rents/discretion. Aligns with our finding that owner-controlled inputs dominate and raw CEO effects need noise correction. |
| Schulze, W., & Zellweger, T. (2021). Property rights, owner-management, and value creation. *Academy of Management Review*, 46(3), 489–511. | How do property rights shape owner vs. manager value creation? | Theory; evidence on owner-managed vs. professionally managed vs. public firms. | Concentrated residual control rights can depress professional manager rents and firm value under owner-management. | Provides theoretical foundation for our owner-vs-CEO control split; motivates why CEO discretion is limited in private firms, consistent with modest true CEO effects after placebo correction. |
| Cole, R. A., & Mehran, H. (2008). *What can we learn from privately held firms about executive compensation?* FRB NY Staff Report 314. | Determinants of CEO compensation in private firms. | U.S. NSSBF (nationally representative small private firms, 1992). | Higher pay–size elasticity (≈0.52) in small private firms; compensation structures differ from public firms. | Shows institutional differences in private-firm contracting. Complementary to our evidence that owners set strategic inputs and CEOs optimize operations with limited discretion. |
| Nakazato, M., Ramseyer, J. M., & Rasmusen, E. B. (2011). Executive compensation in Japan: Estimating levels and determinants from tax records. *Journal of Economics & Management Strategy*, 20(3), 843–885. | Levels/determinants of executive pay in Japan. | Japan; top earners at TSE Section 1 firms; tax records. | Exec pay ≈1/5 of U.S. after size adjustment; stronger link to accounting profits than stock returns; ownership concentration lowers pay. | International benchmark showing institutions/ownership compress executive rents—consistent with our finding that private CEOs’ observable effects are smaller than raw FE suggest. |
| Page, T. B. (2018). CEO attributes, compensation, and firm value: Evidence from a structural estimation. *Journal of Financial Economics*, 128(2), 378–401. | How do CEO attributes and agency frictions affect value and pay? | U.S.; structural model. | Agency frictions sizable: removing them raises value up to ~29%. Attributes explain pay more than firm value. | Our placebo shows most FE dispersion is noise; Page’s small value impact mirrors our modest true CEO effects once noise is purged. |
| Lippi, F., & Schivardi, F. (2014). Corporate control and executive selection. *Quantitative Economics*, 5(2), 417–456. | Do private benefits of control distort executive selection and productivity? | Italy; manufacturing firms (50+ employees), matched ownership–executives. | Family/government control worsens selection; implies ≈10% TFP gap vs. conglomerates. | Corroborates that ownership structure shapes managerial impact. Our results similarly stress owner control; we add measurement separating signal from noise via placebo transitions. |
| Gompers, P. A., Kaplan, S. N., & Mukharlyamov, V. (2023). *The Market for CEOs: Evidence from Private Equity*. NBER WP 30899. | How does the CEO market operate under PE? | U.S. PE buyouts >$1B, 2010–2016; surveys & transactions. | >70% hire new CEOs; >75% external; active replacement; competitive comp in PE. | Highlights strong owner control and active CEO reallocation in private settings. Consistent with our framing of owners setting capital/strategy while CEOs adjust operations. |
| Durand, R., & Vargas, V. (2003). Ownership, organization, and private firms’ efficient use of resources. *Strategic Management Journal*, 24, 667–675. | Are owner-controlled private firms more efficient than agent-led ones? | France; 162 private firms (three industries); DEA efficiency. | Owner-controlled firms more productively efficient than agent-led firms. | Suggests owner control can dominate managerial discretion—aligns with our finding that CEO effects channel through variable inputs, not owner-set capital. |
| Jensen, M. C., & Murphy, K. J. (1990). Performance pay and top management incentives. *Journal of Political Economy*, 98(2), 225–265. | How strong is CEO pay–performance sensitivity? | U.S. public firms; classic incentives study. | CEO wealth changes ≈$3.25 per $1,000 shareholder wealth; overall sensitivity low due to constraints. | Baseline for weak incentives even in public firms; our private-firm setting plausibly features even tighter constraints and smaller true CEO effects. |
| Cziraki, P., & Jenter, D. (2022). *The Market for CEOs*. SSRN working paper. | How are CEOs assigned to firms; how competitive is the market? | U.S. large public firms; hiring patterns and connections. | >80% insider hires; >90% of new CEOs are known to boards; few cross-firm reallocations; pay differences too small to explain choices. | Supports frictions/information constraints in CEO assignment. Our placebo approach mitigates bias from such frictions when estimating CEO effects. |
| Jenter, D., & Llewellyn, K. (2021). Performance-induced CEO turnover. *Review of Financial Studies*, 34, 569–617. | How much turnover is caused by performance? | U.S. public firms; ExecuComp, 1993–2011. | 38–55% of turnovers are performance-induced; total turnover 8–18% by performance decile. | Reinforces that observed CEO changes are endogenous to performance. Our placebo-controlled event studies explicitly adjust for this when measuring CEO value. |
