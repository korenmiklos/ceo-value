               activity on CEO compensation for the full set of CEOs of large
               public U.S. corporations in the Execucomp database over the
               period 1992–2016. Most previous work has focused on publicly
               traded acquisition targets. We focus on the comparison between
               public and private targets, showing significant differences
               between the two. One primary finding, based on panel data
               regressions (using both fixed and random effects) is that the
               performance of private acquisitions, as measured by abnormal
               announcement returns, has a statistically significant positive
               effect of plausible economic magnitude on CEO compensation.
               Public acquisitions exhibit a smaller positive effect that is
               statistically insignificant. For both, acquisition activity
               (number of acquisitions) has a statistically significant positive
               effect on compensation. Our main results suggest that agency
               considerations are important for both public and private
               acquisitions but are more important for public acquisitions.",

               dataset on privately-held and public firm CEO annual compensation
               over the period 1999–2011. We first show that CEOs in public
               firms are paid 30\% more than CEOs in comparable privately-held
               firms. We further show that both private and public firm CEO pays
               are positively and significantly related to firm accounting
               performance, and that the pay–performance link is much weaker in
               privately-held firms. We then show that the above findings are
               robust to accounting for firms' self-selection into being
               privately-held, and a number of important differences between
               privately-held and public firms, including CEO ownership,
               employee stock ownership, stock liquidity, discipline from the
               takeover market, and the availability of different performance
               measures. Overall, our results support the view that concentrated

               shareholder value in the typical firm by 1.74\%, making CEOs risk
               neutral increases shareholder value by 16.12\%, and removing all

               the possibility that the CEO effect might differ in publicly

               longitudinal sample of both publicly traded and large, privately

               greater effect on firm performance, for good or for ill, than do

               exchange-listed U.S. firms) need not disclose executive
               compensation figures in their securities filings, most studies on
               Japan lack even good data on pay. Through 2004, however, the
               Japanese tax office disclosed the tax liabilities of the 73,000
               Japanese with the highest incomes. We obtained this data, and
               match the high-tax list against the list of CEOs of the firms
               listed on Section 1 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We thus estimate
               salaries and risk exposure in a new way. We confirm survey and
               anecdotal evidence that Japanese executives earn less than
               American -- about one-fifth the pay, adjusting for firm size and
               outside income. Tobit regressions show that pay in Japan depends
               heavily on firm size (a .22 elasticity) and on accounting
               profitability, but not on stock returns. Additionally,
               family-owned firms and those with large lead shareholders pay
               less to employee CEOs not in the family or with large
