  author   = "Bertrand, Marianne and Schoar, Antoinette",
  abstract = "This paper investigates whether and how individual managers
              affect corporate behavior and performance. We construct a
              manager-firm matched panel data set which enables us to track the
              top managers across different firms over time. We find that
              manager fixed effects matter for a wide range of corporate
              decisions. A significant extent of the heterogeneity in
              investment, financial, and organizational practices of firms can
              be explained by the presence of manager fixed effects. We
              identify specific patterns in managerial decision-making that
              appear to indicate general differences in ``style'' across
              managers. Moreover, we show that management style is
              significantly related to manager fixed effects in performance and
              that managers with higher performance fixed effects receive
              higher compensation and are more likely to be found in better
              governed firms. In a final step, we tie back these findings to
              observable managerial characteristics. We find that executives
              from earlier birth cohorts appear on average to be more
              conservative; on the other hand, managers who hold an MBA degree
              seem to follow on average more aggressive strategies.",

               varieties would increase a firm's revenue productivity by 22
               percent, about one-half of which is due to imperfect substitution
               between foreign and domestic inputs. Foreign firms use imports
               more effectively and pay lower fixed import costs. We attribute
               one-quarter of Hungarian productivity growth during the 1993-2002
               period to imported inputs. Simulations show that the productivity
               gain from a tariff cut is larger when the economy has many
               importers and many foreign firms. (JEL D24, F13, F14, L60)",

               decision of whether to fire or retain the chief executive
               officer (CEO). We present a model in which weak governance?which
               prevents shareholders from controlling the board?protects
               inferior CEOs from dismissal, while at the same time insulates
               the board from pressures by biased or uninformed shareholders.
               Whether stronger governance improves retain/replace decisions
               depends on which of these effects dominates. We use our
               theoretical framework to assess the effect of governance on the
               quality of firing and hiring decisions using data on the CEO
               dismissals of large U.S. corporations during 1994?2007. Our
               findings are most consistent with a beneficent effect of weak
               governance on CEO dismissal decisions, suggesting that
               insulation from shareholder pressure may allow for better
