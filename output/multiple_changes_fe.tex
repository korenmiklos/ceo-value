Firms with multiple CEO changes are handled by splitting their history into adjacent transition pairs. After collapsing firm-CEO spells, intermediate spells are duplicated so that a firm with spells 1/2/3 contributes two transitions, 1->2 and 2->3. Each transition defines a pseudo-firm, indexed by a constructed identifier (\texttt{fake\_id}) that groups the true firm with the relevant spell window (treated: \texttt{group(frame\_id\_numeric, ceo\_spell)}; placebo: additionally by \texttt{window\_start}, \texttt{window\_end}, and \texttt{change\_year} with an offset to avoid overlap). Fixed effects are estimated separately for these pseudo-firms, so outcomes around different transitions are allowed to have distinct firm intercepts.

These pseudo-firms are not treated as independent statistical units. We retain the original firm identifier and cluster standard errors by the true firm (\texttt{frame\_id\_numeric}), accounting for serial correlation and shared shocks within the underlying entity while identifying off within-firm, between-CEO variation. Intuitively, this design compares outcomes around each transition separately without contaminating the firm effect across multiple changes.
