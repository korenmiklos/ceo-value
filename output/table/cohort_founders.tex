\item \textbf{Notes:} This table reports the number of managers entering each cohort by founder status. Cohorts are defined by the first year a manager appears in the data, grouped in 5-year bins. Founders are defined as CEOs who are also founders of the firm they manage. The sample is restricted to Hungarian managers with non-missing revenue data and at most 4 simultaneous positions. Data source: Hungarian Manager Database (CEU MicroData) merged with firm financial statements, 1986-2022.
